He began saying that he doesn't understand why an action movies they portray, like in a runaway scene or a getaway scene, when people jump off, like the vehicle, they make it seem very easy, when in reality, it hurts a lot. And so she was saying, or he was saying when there was a time when he was nine years old. He was with his mum and his little brother, Andrew, who was only five months old. They were waiting at a bus stop. And they were waiting for a really long time and the bus stop never came. He was talking about something like it's not good to steal people's routes, or something like that. And so eventually, his mom said that they should start walking to try and try and hitchhike. And so eventually, as they were walking, some someone found them and pick them up at the side of the road. And so they got on, but soon after the mini bus had reached them. And so he screamed, or he yelled to them that or he was complaining how the person offering to the family to hitchhike that they were that he was stealing his business. And so his mom said, we were waiting for you and you never came. But it's okay. We'll get on. Because we were going to come on anyway. And so they went on to his mini bus, and they were the only passengers in the bus. And eventually, the driver was insulting the mother saying stuff like you're a whore. Or like, this is or like your and saying stuff like no, or that she's unfaithful? Because she's getting in a vehicle who? with another man who isn't her husband? And saying stuff like, Oh, no wonder it's because you're an apostle. And basically saying, like that she's a slut. And when he said that, he or she, or he also threatened her saying like, I'm going to teach you a lesson tonight. And so, the mom whispered to Trevor, we need to jump out of the bus. And it's like, the driver was speeding. He was driving very fast on the freeway, but whenever there was an intersection, he would slow down just to see if there was traffic. And so she said at the next intersection, let's jump off the van, the minibus and so Trevor didn't really hear what she had said. And he was kind of half asleep. And at the next intersection, she like, dragged him off with her as she jumped off the van or the minibus. And so they were like all bloody and scraped with except for Andrew because the mother was holding on to him. And Trevor was very frustrated with his mom, because he didn't really understand why they had to jump off. But I think in retrospect, he realizes now that he or he didn't realize that. Or he didn't realize at the time that they were in danger and that his mom saved their lives. And that they were probably going to get killed by the driver, or the mom was at risk of being raped as well. And so, at the time when they were walking the mum said, thank God, we're alive. But Trevor said, No, not thank God. This is this is not a good thing. And basically saying that maybe next time Jesus should meet them at their house because he was so frustrated with him. He was also saying that the devil is the reason why this all happened. But his mom was saying no, that's not how this works. God wanted us to be here for a reason. But yeah, when the when Trevor said it's. when Trevor said that Jesus should meet them at the house, they started laughing and it was a good time. Now that it was him and his mom laughing, walking back
