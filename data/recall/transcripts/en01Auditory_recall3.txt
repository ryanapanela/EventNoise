So in this in this story, Trevor is talking about his mom. And well it starts off. He says that when he started going to the salon, he started getting a lot more attention from girls and that he might have thought that it was because he was putting in just as much effort into the his looks that he they were putting into theirs. But once he got him got the formula, he wasn't going to stop. And his mom would like make fun of him for going and getting his hair down all the time. Because she says that she could ever be with a man who put in more effort, or more time and effort into his looks than she did. And he talks about how him and his mom would always kind of like, make fun of each other on like, who's like the hotter one in the family, I guess. And she would always say things like, oh, like you took so long, like at the salon, like getting ready. And like all I have to do is take a shower, and I look great. And he talks about how his mom is like a very attractive woman. And you could always tell that because when she cleaned up, she cleaned up well like for church. But even like when she was like gardening, and there's like, she has like mud all over her, you can still tell that she's like a very attractive woman. He says that she most likely broke a lot of hearts like back in the day. But since Trevor was born, there have only been two men in her in his mom's life. His dad and his stepfather. And his stepfather basically came into the picture. He was a mechanic and they had a very beaten down Volkswagen. And they would end up at the mechanic a lot because of how much problems they would have with their car. And then eventually started seeming like that they would end up at the mechanic even when they didn't have problems with a car. And because Trevor was so young, he didn't really realize what was going on. The mechanics name was Abel, I think, and he was just like, he was like, like, ugly, ugly cute, where his mom would be like, oh, there's a certain type of ugly that women find attractive. And he was like that. Like he wasn't particularly good looking. But he was handsome is what he said like he would like lift things and whatnot. And then eventually, they got married, no ceremony, no big like hullabaloo they just like got married. And then a little while later came his younger brother Andrew. And there was a nine year age gap between him and Andrew. So I guess they weren't like super duper close. And then Trevor moves away to like, become a comedian. And he's like on the road all the time. And then one day, he gets a call from his mom. Or it's coming from his mom's phone and he picks up the phone and its Andrew and he asked him like, hey, like, he's very calm. And he's like, Hey, how are you? Are you busy right now? And Trevor was like, I'm good. No, I'm not busy. And then he says, okay, mom's been shot. And then Trevor have found it very odd that, you know, like, his mom has been shot. And the first thing he didn't say was his mom, like mom's been shot. He said, Hey, how are you? Are you busy right now, which isn't like typically, what would happen in that situation? But he seemed very calm and very stoic. So he, Trevor didn't panic too hard. So he hung up the phone, he said, Okay, like, where are you guys? And they were at the hospital. So he said, Okay, I'm on my way. And then Trevor, ran down the hall and he knocked at someone's door, maybe a roommate or some a neighbor or something. And he said, My mom has been shot. I have to go and they were about 15 minutes by car away from the hospital. So he starts driving and he calls Andrew on his drive, and he asked like, what exactly happened? Oh, he never question. Like when Andrew said that, he'd been shot, he immediately like he didn't have to ask any questions. He immediately assumed that Abel had shot his mom. So then when he called Andrew, he asked what happened? And Andrew said that, you know, they came home and Abel was waiting in the house for them and he shot her when she got out of the car. And Trevor asked, Where did he shoot her shot her in the leg? And he's like, Oh, okay. And then he said, and then he shot her in the head and then that's when Trevor breaks down and starts crying like he's never cried before. And he says that it was a cry that was just pure, a pure expression of pain. And like it was the kind of cry where it was like if, if he could go back to his like former crying selves, he would smack them upside the head because whatever they were crying about was not worth crying for. And then he drove to the hospital through his tears. And then when he came to see his brother, he stood, his brother was like, still calm in the beginning. But then as soon as he saw Trevor, he like, immediately broke down crying, and there were two different types of cries. Trevor's was of pure pain. I didn't really catch what Andrews cry was, but something else. But they both cried for a little while. And then the doctor said that they went in to the emergency room, and the doctor said that she's stable, but there's nothing that you can do right now go home. And so they did. And then they came in the next morning, and she was awake, and she had bandages on the back of her head and her eye was covered and stitches all all along her face. And Trevor sat down next to her and gave her a sip of water and she went, there was a straw in the cup, and she went and she took a sip and then Trevor starts crying and his mom tries to console him. And she tells him to look on the brighter side and he's kind of in disbelief. And he says, what brighter side you almost I thought you were dead. I thought you almost you almost died. I thought you were dead. What's the brighter side and this and then they said some things that I didn't quite hear and they started laughing and and then he mentioned that they were laughing in the ICU on a beautiful sunny day.
