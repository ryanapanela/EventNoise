Okay, so I'm pretty sure the Raiders, Trevor Noah, Trevor Noah, the comedian. But so anyways, when he was a good kid, or like a young teenager, he got cornrows for the first time. And then girls started paying attention to him. And he started going on dates. And he didn't really know if it was because of the hair, or like, because he had the braids done or what, but he wanted to keep that going. So he kept getting braids. And we go to the salon, like once a week, and his mom would laugh at him. Because she said that she would never be with a man who spent more time on his hair. She did. His mom during the week, would like work in her office and spend time in the garden at their house. And she would like dress up like a homeless person and like, not be very, like fancy or anything. But then on Sundays for church, she would like different makeup and put on heels and like a nice dress. And then she would be like, Oh, the queen is back like you got for the most beautiful one in the family for the whole week. But now it's me. And his mom was really big into Jesus, church and praying. And so anyways, this driver only really knew like two men that and mom and no one in their life. She was like very beautiful, and probably broke a lot of hearts. But then there was his original father. And then there is his guy who ended up becoming a stepfather Abel and he worked at the car shop. And their car would break down a lot. So they end up going there to see him a lot but then eventually went into who was like six, it kind of seemed like they were just showing up just because like for no reason to do with the car just because his mom wanted to visit him. And he able was like, kind of ugly, but in like a attractive way. Like his mom said there is a certain type of ugly that women liked. And men and he looked like that. And he was like tall and lanky, but still strong, and he could lift car engines. And so they got married, they didn't have a ceremony or anything. It was just like signing of papers. There were no rings. And then about a year or so after that is when the baby brother Andrew was born. And so when Trevor like when this happened, because he was a little older, this didn't like have a big effect on his life. I've been a bigger brother. So he just kind of kept like he would go to the town and play games in the arcades and stuff. But then he moved out and he started doing comedy. And he wasn't around his family as much anymore. And then one day he gets waking up from a call from on his on his mom's phone, but when he picks up the phone, it's his brother Andrew, his brother is like hi, how are you? Drivers? Like, you know, good. How are you? Andrew is like are you busy? I'm kind of sleeping like, but why? And then Andrew is like mom has been shocked. And this totally freaks Trevor out. And he runs to his roommate and said, my mom's been shot and they get in the car and go to the hospital. And on the way, they're like they're stopped at a traffic light. And Trevor calls Andrew to get more details. But what happened to his mom because he was upset that his brother didn't just tell him right away. Like he kind of had the pleasantries and everything when they were on the phone. And so he wanted to know more about when it happened. And then Andrew said, that able, like his dad and Trevor stepped out and shot their mom. When they were coming back from church. She was waiting at their house in the car. And yeah, he shot her mom in the leg, and then also in the head. And then Trevor could remember exactly what street like they were at. And he was crying their tears, and just like couldn't really see where he was driving, but he knew he had to just get to the hospital. And originally when his brother had called to tell him that mom had been shot. covered, like fill in the blanks that it was able who did it like, as soon as he heard his mom was shot. That's how we who we knew it was like he just knew and then when they get to the hospital, there was an outdoor waiting area. And they had to wait there because his mom was being sedated and they were doing surgery stuff on her. And then when he got there and he saw Andrew Andrew like broke down because he'd been kind of holding it together until Trevor got there. But then they cried a lot together. And the doctors told them to go home. The Trevor came back right the next morning, like bright and early first thing is they could sit with his mom and be there when she woke up and she had bandages on the back of her head and stitches and, like bandages over one of her eyes. And so eventually she did, she opened her eye that wasn't covered by the bandages, and she like, kind of woke up and then seeing this totally Trevor crying again. And then she asked for some water, and she had to lean forward a bit to slip through the straw. And then, when she saw Trevor crying, she like, oh, like, don't cry, baby, like, don't cry. And she was like, come on, how could I not cry from shot? He was like, well, at least, you know, you'll always be the most beautiful one in the family now, because we have all these scars and bandages and stuff. And then they laughed, and I was like, still crying tears laughing and they were laughing together. And yeah, they had like a bonding moment. Out of that, this moment, looking on the bright side. And Trevor thought that his mom didn't deserve this happening to her because she was such a devoted like Christian like middle praying to she just said all that like she had put in a lot of prayer and she was like in that top 100 of the Jesus fan club and so she shouldn't have this bad thing happened to her
