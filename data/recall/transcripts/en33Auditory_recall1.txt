There was three Chinese students who entered the speaker's school for the first time. It was the very first Chinese people he's ever encountered. One of them was Ronnie. The other one was Bruce Lee. And the third one was John. Bruce Lee was very attractive. Ronnie was he was a pirater or, as well, his parents, both his parents got their money from pirating movies and CDs and other things and Ronnie fell into their footsteps. He would pirate CDs for people in school. And then he got a partner, which was a white boy named Andrew. And they would pirate CDs and sell them to people together. And then, but anytime they had black customers, or they were scared of black people, and anytime they had black customers that didn't pay, they were scared to haggle with them, or like, go out and get the money that was owed to them. So they would kind of lose that money. They had the mentality that black people were poor, and they couldn't afford it. So they didn't really go out to pressure the black people to give them the money that was owed to them. And that's how they recruited the speaker into their little pirating team. And all three of them would pirate CDs and DVDs and stuff like that for people illegally and sell them. And they were all based in South Africa, the currency was RANDS. Bronie's parents were incarcerated. And I believe Ronnie was later incarcerated. And then the speaker always wanted a CD writer, but he couldn't afford one. And but with the money that he was making from pirating CDs with Ronnie and Andrew, he was able to upgrade his life a bit more.So Bronie was incarcerated, and then Andrew matriculated, which I'm assuming is graduating and then Andrew gave the speaker a CD writer and from there onwards the speaker continued to like pirate CDs and DVDs things like that. And as as times changed and yeah, as times change and music evolved, most people were very interested in American r&b and hip hop music. So he was pirating a lot of that and he was pirating a lot of American r&b songs but he was Christian. So he wasn't really exposed to that music a lot he was more listening to Christian or gospel music um he never pirated see CDs or DVDs for himself because he had the mentality don't get high on your own stash. Yeah, as as times changed and music developed. A lot of people started coming to him to make like mixtapes, I guess so, instead of pirating. See, or like music from one specific album, he did like a mix of like different albums to make it like a unique mixtape. Then it evolved even more and it became kind of like a like he would pirate songs and have them flow into one another. So like a DJ set. And he did that for a while. Um, he had a phone that he would walk down the street with. I'm assuming it's one of those phones with like an antenna that he would like draw out. Yeah
