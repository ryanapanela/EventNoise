Okay, so in this one, they started off talking about buses and a transportation system. And how they, there was like, a separate transportation system. And then I don't know what happened, but they ended up in a car. Yeah, they were in a car and someone was yelling. And then I think the someone was like, oh, like, what are you doing by yourself or with two young kids? Because it was like a mother and then her two kids. And they were like, oh, like, what are you doing by yourself? Like they didn't, like I guess, expect that or whatever. And then the mom must have said something because it seemed like the driver got angry and was like, like, saying that we're gonna kill them or was like, Oh, you wait and see what happens or something like that. And then they started driving really fast. And then oh, it's actually started off with the narrator being like, it looks like when people like come out of a car, they like move out of a rolling car, like roll out of a car or whatever, like in an action scene, like, it doesn't hurt that much. And he's like, Oh, it actually hurts way more than you would think it does. Because then what ended up happening is that they were driving really fast. And then I guess they had to escape the car, because they thought that the mom thought that the driver was going to kill them. And so she like, opens the car door. And then I guess, like, pushes the kid out of the car so that he can like leave the car. And then there was also another kid, and also grabbed the kid. So they all fall out of the car, basically. And then they start she well, as he's realizing what happened, she like looks at him and, or, and he looks at her and she's like, already on her feet. And she yells at him to run. And then they both start running until they reach some other place like a motel or something. And then he's like, What was that for? Like, what happened? Like, I was basically half asleep, and she's like, they were going to kill us. That's why I told you to run. And then they kind of started like talking and I guess, like, laughing with each other because he was like, like, you know, at least if they killed me, she said, What do you mean? Like they were gonna kill us? And then he said, well, at least if they killed us, like they would have woken me up first. And so I guess like he didn't really realize what was happening until it already happened. And then they were starting to leave. And the mom was like, Oh, like this is all God's plan. And he was like, What do you mean like this? God was warning us not to go originally when the car originally didn't start because I guess the car didn't start at the beginning. And then she was like, No, like everything is God's plan and like there's a reason that we're here and then they ended up laughing together and then they they went home
