Alright, so in this story, the narrator begins with talking about his life at school and how. At the beginning, there were three Chinese students brought into the school the only three Chinese students out of the 1000s of kids at the school. The three of them are named Bolo, Bruce Lee and John Bolo was named after the character from the John Claude Van Damme movie Bloodsport. Bruce Lee was actually Bruce Lee and the narrator Thanks Jesus for that. So you know, good on him. And John has just John apparently. The focus goes on to bolo, whose parents are professional pirates in the sense that they pirate video games and media and bolo takes after his parents and does the same kids in the school would bring over their Playstations. And Bolo would take them for a few days put a chip in them, so that they can accept pirated games, and then they would sell he would sell the pirated games to them as well, thus, making a lot of money and contributing to piracy. Problems arise, however, it's I should also mention it. There's also a kid named Andrew helping them out as well. But there's a problem with Bolo and Andrew, though they can make money they have a problem with some of the black kids saying that they'll pay later and they don't pay. Yes, this is that kind of story. There are racial matters to discuss here. Let's not get antsy. The narrator says to Andrew Bolo that he can act as a middleman where he will take care of the the money problems and moving merchandise and in exchange, he gets a cut of the money to which Bolo and Andrew agree, they think it's a good idea. And naturally, things sort of take off from there and our narrator gets exposure to the world of piracy and the media copying eventually Bolo leaves the school the rumor being that his parents, as pirates were caught and arrested and so on from there, and Andrew decides to depart from the piracy scene, but gives the narrator his CD writer, as thanks for his help. And with that CD writer, the narrator continues, continues the life of piracy, by which they record CDs and sell them where the average price is the equivalent of $3 for one of his CDs, it it's a much better bargain than what one would get from the normal CD vendors. And once with a deal like that, no one wants to buy at the market and they go on from there and as he accrues more money, he the narrator upgrades his technology the his setup as prior he was working with just salvage car speakers and the CD writer. And as technology improves, and the more money comes comes in, the narrator is able to further upgrade their technology and their transmitting capabilities. Even getting to the point where they can attempt to hire their own middle middlemen to help facilitate with a moving the merchandise. And one of his as a as a technology continues to go and recording gets better. The narrative provided whatever music the clientele wants, and in particular, moving away from the more Christian the more friendly stuff to the I believe it was called black music in the story, you know, hip hop and r&b with an emphasis on artists like jagged edge for example. And he doesn't care what the client's tastes are just if you need the CD, I'll take care of it for you before they used to, you know, come home from school and spend five to six hours putting CDs together and doesn't matter what what the client wants. If the client wants to DMX, they get DMX. And eventually one of the middlemen has an idea of why not compile the what instead of selling albums directly why not create Greatest Hits CDs and send them through there and the narrator  thinks that's a good idea. And then following from that the narrator is suggested by the same middleman that why not instead of making it a tracklist have it so that the songs fade in and fade out to each other as if it was a DJ performing a set, and that's a good idea as well. And the narrator is able to buy a program with the interface resembling to DJ vinyl records and is able to customize the tracks to their liking. And through that, they're able to create mixes party CDs, and sell them. And the story concludes with a narrator remarking that even though even though he had the talent to do this sort of work, he wouldn't have had the chance. Had someone from a more privileged, more educated background taken notice of him and given him the tools in order to get his business running. Though he remarks that his remark is that to Andrew, his white friend, has, you know, he, from his upbringing he and the privilege his family has, he that they take what they have they take for granted relative to what the narrator does, where the narrator describes, as you know, his people being put into huts and being condescendingly told via song, you know, two times two is four, two times three is six. And remarking, as I said that and also, like the condescension of you know, do better, you know, don't take stock that you're poor and get yourself out of it. But the narrator remarks with what resources can you get yourself out, as he said, You can have the talent but you need the resources to get it done. The analogy he gives, from what others have told him is, you know, give a man a fish he eats for a day Teach a man to fish, he'll eat forever. But your remarks, but they never tell you. We need to give the man a fishing rod. Yeah. So without Andrew taking notice of him and giving him the CD writer to make this all happen in the first place, his talent wouldn't have blossomed and he wouldn't have knowledge of music and of piracy and the business model that goes with it. So yeah, and I think the more appropriate analogy for the fish store is unrelated but to teach a man to fish he'll sit in a boat drinking beer all day. All right, that's That's it. Thank you.
