So the narrator of this story named Trevor starts off by saying he's not impressed with action movies where the main character gets thrown out of a car, and is able to land sort of dust themselves off and get up as if it was nothing. Because as the story will tell you, he's had firsthand experience getting thrown out of a car and it's very, very painful. So he wakes up, his mother wakes him up. And as he eats breakfast, his mom dresses up his younger brother, Andrew. And they're supposed to leave the house. But the car they're there, their car unfortunately, won't start. The narrator then mentions that for transit, where they're from, there are mini buses that go around, but it's unregulated transportation almost in the form of organized crime as such. There's a lot of violence, bribery, corruption, and even people being killed as a result and the and there's not much that can be done about it. And the one thing that these organized mini buses absolutely detest above all others, is other buses stealing their routes, which is pretty much death sentence. So all this in mind, the mother suggest to her son, since the car won't start, why don't we hitchhike? And they do so and eventually a car picks them up, but not 10 feet later, they're cut off by a minibus, who forces them to stop and gets the driver out of the car. The people who were in the minibus are Zulu men with a clubs designed to break people's skulls open. And as the driver is getting roughed up, the mother speaks up and says he was just giving us a ride. If we wanted to go with you guys in the first place as the mini buses, it's either they show up or they don't show up as there's no organized schedule. And they go from the car that pick them up to the excuse me to the mini bus and they drive off. Now the narrator remarks that Zulu men are rather belligerent and complaining especially about traffic on the road. But the one other thing they'll complain about is the differences between themselves and also culture. And given that the mother is of that culture and as a mixed race child's you know, she's deemed a whore you know, someone who sleeps with white men, it's Yeah, and as the situation escalates in the van, the narrator is nodding off because while the situation is escalating, his mother is remaining calm and trying to be reasonable with the driver who says and, and she says things like, you know, it's okay, you can let us off here we'll walk the rest of the way. But the driver keeps saying No, and it's a there's an implication that things are gonna get violent as soon as things as soon as the journey ends, and so the driver of the minibus is going very quickly, only slowing down at intersections to check for traffic. And as the narrator's nodding off it. He's told by his mother, that at the next intersection, when they slows down, when they driver slows down, he's they need to jump out of the minibus and open the door and jump out of the minibus but the narrator has nodded off by then. And as as the story progresses, that that happens, the mother opens the door to the mini buses, the driver slows down at the intersection throws Trevor the narrator outside bundles Andrew the little brother and she rolls out of the car as well. And to the narrator it seemed like a dream until they hit the ground and it nothing but pain. And the mom the same she rolls with her son down the hill rolling, rolling, rolling until they come to a stop and they're pretty scraped up and bloody butt Following that, the mother tells the narrator to run and when she says run, yeah, he knows to run. And while the Zulu men thought they could maybe catch these guys, the lady didn't know they were dealing with running champions of I don't remember the name of the institution. And so they run and the kid although nine years of age is trained enough to know that when his mother says Run, run when there's a armored cars running around, you know, hide run. With a running, they were running on pure adrenaline almost animal instinct, I believe he, the term was used, and they just run and run and the Zulu drivers had no chance to catch them and they just drove away. So they ran until they hit a petrol station, at which point the pain set in and both the mother and son got a good look at each other. The son was pretty scraped up and torn and bloodied and dirty, then the mother was about the same. But fortunately, Andrew was okay since he'd been bundled up. And at the petrol station, they catch their breath, and they call the police, but by them, the men are gone, so the police can just take them home. And the son remarks that not the mother remarks, this is all part of God's plan. And the son says, No, it's not part of God's plan. That was the devil teasing us. And we should have stayed home when the car broke down. And the you know, the and the mom says, No, that's, this is not the devil's work. This is how God's plan works sometimes. And the son says, Mom, I know you love Jesus, but next time have him meet us at our house and she the mother smiles and laughs and the kid smiles and laughs too. So yeah, that's the end of the story.
