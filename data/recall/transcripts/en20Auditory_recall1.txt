The narrator is Trevor. And pretty much in the beginning, he was kind of describing how he always likes to kind of style his hair and how girls may find that attractive or they kind of relate to him, given that they too, also spent a lot of time, styling themselves in terms of their hair. And Trevor begins to talk also about his mother, and how every day from Monday all the way to Saturday, the mom would often be dressed kind of like a homeless, and often tending to her gardens. But it's always on the Sunday before she goes to church, she always kind of make sure she's presentable. And she looks like a million bucks. And her hair has done well. But it's always just for church. And really, he was describing how his mom's very religious and always likes to joke around about being the best looking one with little effort compared to Trevor, who has to put lots of effort in order to get his hairdo right. And he talked about his childhood, about how he eventually he and his mom often go to this kind of car mechanics where they met Abel, who became pretty much a love interest and then they got married to Trevor's mom. And through that, they conceived a child named Andrew. And there was an age gap, about nine years of an age gap between Trevor and his brother, Andrew. First, Trevor eventually went to somewhere in the United States to really pursue his dream and comedy. And one night, he got a phone call from his brother, Andrew. And pretty much Andrew was very calm on the phone asking Hello, how are you? But mom's been shot. And Trevor described how his brother was so calm, and kind of bewildered about the fact that his own brother was so calm. And why wasn't he kind of anxious? Like the first thing one would say is not hello, how are you but rather like mom's been shot. And then Trevor goes on to then further narrate how he started panicking. He was driving towards the hospital. And really, he was just kind of bawling. His eyes out he was in a very kind of emotional, yet surreal, bewildered experience and you're describing all these emotions. And by time he entered the hospital. The first person he saw was his brother. And he described the emotion in which the brothers grief was more of helplessness while Trevor's grief was more of overwhelming sadness, frustration, anger, all that combined. And he really described how his brother was really holding it in and kind of keeping himself calm and put together but that kind of broke until he saw Trevor and then Trevor at that night, he wasn't able to see his mother. However, later on. The next day, he was able to visit the mom and the mom was bandaged up around the head. And Abel, the stepfather or Trevor's mom's husband was the one that shot her. So shot Trevor's mom, first on the leg, and then in the head, at the back of the head. So that's why the mom was bandaged up on the back of the head. Luckily, she was in stable condition. And while he was kind of sitting on the bed side of the mother, he again kind of felt anger, frustration, frustration about why did this happen to his mother? because she's very religious and he said how the mother if there could be a top list of people who believed in Jesus, she would be in the top 100. And he also described that frustration about wanting to have ill will and murderous intentions to kill Abel and just really kind of questioning the universe of all why has to happen to a good person. But then the mother woke up. And, um, you know, she was very calm, she was soothing Trevor, and eventually she made a joke about how now, Trevor is now the good looking person in the family.
