Care Trevor and Andrew are back. Trevor is our narrator again. And this time, he's nine years old. So him his baby brother Andrew and his mom are about to head out. And sorry, he starts the narrative by talking about in movies, when someone jumps out of a car, the moving car, or bus or truck or whatever, and they land and then they get up immediately and brush themselves off as if nothing happened as if nothing hurt. They don't have a scratch. And he's like, that's not actually how it feels, and proceeds to tell the story about the time he was thrown out of a moving vehicle. So him, his baby, brother, Andrew and his mom are getting in the car, to go to church, maybe, and the car won't start. And they try and try and it's not starting. So they decided to take public transportation, except during the apartheid in South Africa, there is no public transportation for black people. It's not allowed. And so the community has made their own, like, illegal public transportation system using mini buses, and it's all unregulated. So it's a lot of territorial stuff. It's kind of like gang, run by gangs. And you don't take other people's routes, or you could get killed. It's very territorial, and pretty dangerous. So they decided to wait for this minibus. And because it's unregulated, you know, they either show up or they don't, and there's nothing you can do about it. So they wait for the mini bus. And the mini buses not coming. So they decide to hitchike, or the mom was like, let's just hitchike. So they walk. And then this car stops and offers to take them. So they get in the car, and they're driving around, and the driver slams on the brakes, because one of the mini buses is about to hit them. So they stop. And then these two guys get out of the minibus and one of them is holding a club that is used to smash skulls. And he goes up to the driver opens the door and pulls him out. And it's threatening him being like you don't pick up our people. How dare you, blah, threatening him. And Trevor thinks that this guy is going to kill the driver. So his mom's setups up? And she says, Oh, no, we were waiting for you. You guys weren't coming. He was just helping us we'd be happy to ride with you just leave him alone. So she gets the guys to leave the driver alone. And Andrew and Trevor Andrew and their mom, get into the minibus, and they're all alone. Now it I don't remember the tribe names, but they're basically two tribes that our that are enemies. And the guy driving the minibus and Trevor's mom are from different tribes. So he has a lot of prejudice against her, saying that she is a slut and that she shouldn't be getting into cars with men who aren't her husband. And either Trevor or Andrew is also a mixed child. So he calls her a whore who sleeps with white men, blah, blah, blah, and he's like, you're gonna get what's coming to you tonight. So now the mom is frightened. And she she stays calm for Trevor and Andrew, but she's trying to negotiate her way off the bus saying that. It's okay. They can walk like just let her there's let him out. Let us out here. And the driver keeps saying no. And I don't think Trevor realized it at the time. Or so he says but he's probably him and Andrew probably going to be killed tonight and his mom raped. So I think he says that in hindsight, because on the bus, he's actually half asleep. He's really tired. He just wants to go to bed. And they're sitting by the sliding door entrance and his mom is sitting next to him with Andrew in her lap, and she leans over to Trevor saying that at the next light when drivers slows down, open the door and jump out. And Andrew doesn't. Trevor doesn't hear this because he is asleep at this point. So the driver slows down the next right light. The mom opens the door and throws Trevor out the door, and then wraps herself around Andrew and throws herself out as well. And Trevor has no idea what's happening because he's asleep. And then all of a sudden, he's not. And he wakes up and he's on the ground, and his mom yells at him to run. And he doesn't even think about it. It's just instinct. So he starts running. And they're both running, and the guys driving the minibus, get out. And they don't even try and chase them because they're too fast. So they keep running, Trevor looks behind him and sees the moment when they give up and just go back. So they run and they run her, his mom is like a race champion, back from college. So they run to a petrol station 24 hours, and they call the police. And then Trevor and his mom get into an argument. He's like, Why did you throw me out the bus and she was like, because you didn't jump and he was like I'm asleep. And then they start arguing about God. And Trevor says that they should have listened to God when he didn't want the car to start that the devil must have learned them out tonight. And his mom says that that's not how the devil works. And Trevor is like, well, next time God should come to us or Jesus should come to us.In the end, they're smiling. And I don't remember why. They called the police and they're waiting for the police to come
