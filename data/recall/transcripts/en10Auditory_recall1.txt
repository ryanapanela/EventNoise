When the narrator was in school, there were three Chinese kids. I don't know, one of them was Bolo and one of them was one of one of the three Chinese kids family does pirating. And the kid the chinese kids, family who does a pirating bring a brought their i don't know the pirated products to school and sold them. And I think someone took advantage of them and just because they were too scared took advantage of that fear and just said that they would pay for their stuff, but then they didn't pay the Chinese kids and then and then the narrator somehow was friends with the pirating kid, pirating Chinese kid and but then the Chinese kids family was arrested. And the narrator start making his own business he he went to McDonald's, and he would tell his friend, he went to McDonald's and then his business very successful because some of his friends told him that oh, you should make them into a CD from track one to track two his his friends gave him two advice. And they and he took both of them. The first one is somehow I forgot but it's about how they should combine songs together so that it's kind of like a DJ thing. And because people only want to hear you know, only wants to listen to music they really like they only want to listen to songs they really like instead of other random songs than don't really care about and he was really successful because of one of his privileged friend and he said something like people often say t- people often say don't give a man a fish instead teach him how to fish but they never say something I forgot what the thing is. And and he said that it's really important to have a full fledged friend who told you that who tells you what to do and what you need. The narrator wasn't privileged but his friend who give him advice was. Black American music was really a hit back then. I think Western African music was like, okay, like barely Okay, compared to like af-, black American music and the narrator mentioned the word merchandise. The narrator was really successful towards the end.
