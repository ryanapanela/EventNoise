In this story, Trevor recalls the situation with his mother and his brother who was a baby at the time at and their incident with a mini bus. So his mother, him and his baby brother wanted to go somewhere in the evening or in the night, and their car wouldn't start. So they decided they were going to take a bus. And at this time in apartheid, South Africa there was seg- segregation. So only the white South Africans could take the public transit, the official like legal transit, whereas black South Africans had to take well, they they had to make their own transit system out of necessity. And this led to it being like a criminal kind of organization. And it was illegal. And it was chaotic. And different people, different teams of people would have different buses and different networks, and they would compete. So Trevor, his brother and his mother, get on one bus. And then this bus gets cut off, and by another bus, where the man tells them to get in, and the mother said, Oh, we were going to we're trying to take your bus anyway. And they get onto this bus. And he was upset and ranting to the mother. And when the mother responded, he could tell by her accent, what type of South African and that she was, and one that he and it was a type that he didn't like. He compared her to the type that he does like and says that they're better, they're more proper. And that her type was not in comparison, and that they were dirty or a woman. And she was he was insulting her and the mother talk, spoke back and they were arguing. Eventually the man said, Oh, I'll teach you a lesson. And he started driving really fast speeding. And so his mother was saying, Oh, you can just let us out now we'll just walk, we're fine. And the man said no. And he kept speeding. And at this point, the mother remained calm. But of course, she was worried about what may happen. Trevor mentions that for all he knows, she could have been killed or been raped. And but at the time, he was trying to sleep as it was late and he didn't really know what was going on. Eventually, the mother whispers to him to open the door or the window and the door. And eventually, he well he opens the door, and then his mother throws him out of the car of the minibus, and she jumps out as well, wrapping up his baby brother and sheltering him before she jumps and they hit the ground. And they tumble once they're out the minibus and onto the street. And his mother gets up and says run and so he runs after he runs away and he's still confused and doesn't understand why that just happened. Why he was thrown out but he runs anyway. He mentions that living where he lived and he was used to following orders for in case of danger, he was used to running when he sees helicopters above and for safety. So it was animal instinct, he knew that he had to follow his orders the orders of his mother, even if he didn't understand and he ran, and she ran with him. The men in the bus was confused. They tried to follow after but eventually gave up. They were bewildered at their ability to get right up after jumping out. At the beginning of the story, Trevor had mentioned that when watching action movies and the action hero or whoever would jump out of a car and land and tumble, that it was unrealistic how they were able to get right back up and, and act like nothing happened like it didn't hurt. He compares, eventually. This gets compared with his experience getting thrown out of a car and how much that hurt and compare. And how, while he was running well, he didn't realize how much it hurt until after he stopped once he got to the gas station, the 24 hour gas station with his mother, and his leg started really hurting and his the skin on his elbows were completely scraped off and his knees were bleeding and scraped. His mother also was injured but his baby brother was fine because of his mother sheltering him. And him and his mother start arguing. Once again, he couldn't understand that how much danger that he was in and his mother was not was was telling him that well. Oh, she asked him, Why didn't you jump when I when she said that? Oh, I was sleeping I didn't know. Eventually, they start arguing about God's place in this situation and how he wished that their car not start, starting at the beginning was a sign that they shouldn't have left the house that night anyway. And the mother responds that this was in God's plan. And he wanted to bring us out here. And yes, they argue but ultimately, it ends with the mother telling him that she loves him. And he says he loves her too.
