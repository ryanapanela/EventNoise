Uh, the main character starts by talking about how in movies he's seen, people will jump out of moving cars and roll onto their backs and get up. And it seems so simple, but to him, it's rubbish, because that's not how it that's not how he experienced it. He talks about how him and his mother and his baby brother somehow ended up in one in a van that was part of a net, like an independent network of busses, and they were going somewhere, and when suddenly, like a large truck, slammed into the side of the van they were in, and the driver got out, and the driver of the truck that slammed into the van got out and started yelling at the driver of the van about how they've stolen that, about how he has stolen their customers. And then told the main character, his mother and his baby brother to get in the truck. And so they did, and the guy was like, that's very unproper of you to sit in a van with a strange man. And she said, mind your own business. And I guess that angered the driver, so he started behaving weirdly, and they realized that the mother realized that they were going to get killed, so she formulated a plan and whispered to the main character, which he didn't hear at the time, to jump out of the car when the car stops at a signal, and when the car rolled to a stop at a signal, the mother slid open the sliding door and pushed him out while he was basically like half asleep, because he was half asleep in the car, and pushed him out and he continued rolling onto the ground, and The mother herself and the baby brother curled up into a ball so as to protect the younger, the baby brother, and also jumped out of the car. And they continued rolling, rolling, rolling. And when they stopped, they got up. And the mother screamed, run. And so they ran and they ran and they ran. And the driver of the car attempted to come, attempted to chase down, chase them down, but eventually failed. And the main character says he remembers the face of that of the driver as he as he, as He, gave up chasing them. And so they ran until they reached a 24 hour petrol station, and then the main character realized how much pain he was in because the adrenaline rush. He didn't realize when he was running, but when he, like, came to a stop at the 24 hour petrol station, he realized how much pain he was in, and there were, like, scuff marks and skid marks and cuts like all over his body and his mother's body. But his baby brother, obviously, was unharmed because he was in his mother's arms when they jumped out of the car, the main character continues by yelling at his mother and saying, Why did you not wake me up when wake me up to tell me that we were gonna jump out of the car? And he got very mad. And he's like, this was not very like it was it's not very nice. And she's like, and the mother was like, oh, so I should have left you in the car to die for those men to kill you. And he's like, Well, at least they would have woken me up to kill me. And they argued back and forth some more, and eventually, I think the police came and everything. When they were arguing, the mother was like, Oh, this is all part of God's plan. And the main character was like, Well, no, because the devil tricked us into leaving our house. And the mother was like, No, that's not how the devil works.
