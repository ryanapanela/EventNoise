So the story starts off with how the main character describes how they're he goes to this school, high school, I'm assuming, where he had only three Chinese kids or something like that. One of them was like named Bolo or something. The other was aptly named named Bruce Lee, who is apparently also, he was also very, you know, fit, and good looking whatever. And he had a third guy who was just named John and was kind of just there. So, throughout his time at school, this one could follow whatever the first one was, are very much into piracy, because of his parents, his parents ran a piracy business where they would take these CDs and burn illegal copies of video games onto the CDs and hand them out and make money off of that. So as a result, his son sort of started getting into that too. And as a result, he would go around school, taking people's Playstations ringing them up with a chip that would allow them to sort of gain access to these bootleg copies of PlayStation video games. And as such, they can go home and play their new bootleg videogames. So he made a quite a decent bit of money off of this. And there is another guy at school named Andrew, who was also sort of in this kind of business. So these two kids made a lot of money off of selling pirated games to their local school community. However, they came across this dilemma, where, um, you know, some of the kids for, I guess, not really paying back, or they were kind of too afraid to sort of act as a loan shark and get their money back from the kids who weren't really, you know, responsibly paying back, I guess. So, I, this was mostly just based on the fears, or like a prejudice of other people explaining like, you know, they're black. So they're too afraid to sort of confront these black kids and get their money's back. So main character sort of just stepped in and was like, hey, you know, that's just how some of us black kids are, you know, well, we'll say we'll, we'll do this thing or borrow from you. And then, you know, it might take some time, or whatever it was, but the reason being that, you know, black kids were poor. So they're kind of trying to do things in like a cheaper way or more shady way. Anyways, he told them not to really worry about that sort of stuff. And as a black kid himself, he could handle acting as a middleman for them. So the two, the two kids were like, pretty interested in that they're like, Okay, yeah, that sounds like a great business opportunity. I'll give you the he told him like, you'll give me the all the tools necessary, like the CDs and whatnot, all the products. And I will like this middleman and handle these cases. And just give me a small portion of the cut. And we'll work that out as a business. So they definitely liked that idea. And as a result, Trevor ended up acting as a middleman and he already had his you know, network at school. So all he had to do is lay his plan to action. So he ended up sort of acting as their middleman for some time making enough money to buy extra storage space for his computer, whatever it was, at the time, under the guidance of the Chinese kid at their school Bolo or whatever, and telling him you know, what to do, how to buy whatever. And he would just save up, 2000 Rand or whatever to buy that necessary upgrade. There came a time where his parents, Bolo's parents had to apparently supposedly got caught and went to jail. So he ended up leaving school. As a result, Andrew and him are the only ones left to run the business of pirating stuff and selling at school. But at some point in time, I guess Andrew had to leave or something. And he basically just told the main character, Trevor, like, you know what you have been a loyal and great friend throughout all of this. So he gave him his CD writer or whatever. And to Andrew at the time, he had this so it allowed him to burn CDs or do whatever, but it was like, definitely the most expensive part of the computer back then. And cost just as much as the computer itself that part alone. So it was a really highly possessed item that Trevor was saving up for, you know, it takes some time to get and he sort of just gave it to him as a gift for his gratefulness. As a result, the main character was like in complete shock and awe at this fact. Like he just been given a divine gift for this CD writer. Because what this meant was that it gave him a lot of access to pirating now and doing things himself, main character explained how he really had this aptitude for business side of things. But you know, he sort of needed the tools. So once he had the CD writer he just started going crazy but doing the business himself he would pirate all sorts of things. So, you know, he mentioned he didn't really care about music all he had his Christian music at home. But you know, people want it to listen to nirvana or whatever, you know, you got it. Sure. I'll burn it on the CD, sell it to you. Whatever it was, so people were coming to him with more requests, like, oh, yeah, why don't you Why don't you do like, you know, instead of giving me this new DMX tape. Why don't you give me like a mixtape on a CD, just a mix of all these different songs. People have different tastes and stuff? And he's like, Yeah, yeah, sure. Sounds like a great idea. So he was making money off of doing that. And then other people were coming to him like, Oh, why don't you make the tracks fade in fade out kind of like a DJ sort of thing? It's like, yeah, you got that. I think at some point, he also mentioned he started, you know, doing porn or something onto the CDs, burning, whatever. Anyways, basically just got kind of shady. And he was doing a lot of illegal piracy, sort of things, burning CDs, and illegal pirating of music, video games, and any other sort of material. He didn't really question other people's tastes, because he didn't really understand it. Due to him not having like a music background. He said, like zoom, or whatever music thing. He said, Zoom music back then was like, obviously, something that people listened to. But what people really craved were like, you know, hip hop, African American sort of music, as he described it, at the time, that being like hip hop and r&b. So people were really going crazy for that. And that was making him the money. But, um, basically, he ended up going on talking about how this pivots and transitions to this idea of, you know, success in the African American lifestyle that they had in South Africa at the time. So at the time, it was like, you know, he built this successful network made a lot of money, to the point where he was literally traveling to McDonald's talking to people, as he was going there, as if he has some rich dude. Kind of almost flaunting his money buying McDonald's every day, in a time where computers were not that developed, right. But he made this out to be like a sort of, what do you call it, he made, he went back on the Proverbs saying, you know, people really love to lecture you about these sort of things like, oh, you should be responsible with your power and whatnot. And people love to say you teach a fish, sorry, you give a man a fish once and you know, you satisfy him for a day, you teach them how to fish, you satisfy him for a lifetime, as he's mocking the proverb. But saying, like, you know, people usually forget to say the part where you it would be nice if he also gave the tools necessary to fish like a fishing rod. And that being given this gift was sort of a reflection on that, right, it felt for the first time he was giving the tools needed to succeed, and to empower himself in that, you know, despite all this talent that he may have had for business acumen, what point is there to actually using it if you don't have the tools necessary to allow you to really compete and do what you're needed to do. And he explained how Andrew and like, you know, these white people, froms from his schools, they had these parents that already could afford CD writers and whatnot, and they have the tools and resources that people like him couldn't really even dream of, and, you know, they're just doing these things as they're preparing to go to university. But for for him, it was like a sort of different outlook or perspective. It was like, for a first time he was given these tools necessary to succeed. And he went back thinking like, you know, a lot of people just say, like, oh, you know, that's just a handout though. Like as if his hard work didn't pay off for itself but he ends up going to describe like, you know, and he has people often need to, they don't have the access to resources to let them flourish their talents. Unlike in this case, where he was given the access to the CD writer, but
