So the story starts off with the main character, who is called Trevor. And he talks about how he's about to go to the dance. And he's getting his hair down into cornrows, I believe. And once he started sort of dressing His hair this way, he noticed he was receiving a lot of attention from girls, whatever, how he was more likely to be sort of asked out, and the main character was contemplating themselves that, you know, maybe this is because of my new hairstyle, maybe the woman are now thinking, Oh, he's like, this guy's putting as much time into his hair and his self care routine as other ladies do, et cetera. So he started contemplating, like, why he's getting a lot more attention now. And as a result, he ends up starting to spend a lot of his time going over his hairdo. So throughout the entire week, he would spend up to, I don't know, four hours at the salon, getting his hair done. And then his mother would sort of come in and make snide remarks about it, talking about how, you know, he spends more time at the salon doing his hair than she does as a lady. And the main character also begins to sort of talk about his mom and how she would basically be doing outside yard work in her garden dressed up looking like a homeless person, as she does her gardening work, in her overalls and whatnot. So we're sort of getting this introduction, as if maybe she didn't look that great. But he then goes on to describe how, despite how she looked like this, there is one time of the week that she would always dress up very nicely. And this was like, for Sunday church. So she would wear high heels put on her best looking dress. And during that one time of the week, she would come up through her son and be all smug talking about look at me now. I am. You know, I'm very beautiful whatnot. Sort of like making it into a mini competition between son and mother about who's the best looking now and trying to tell her son to be taught his place sort of in that regard. And then the character, the main character starts to pivot towards talking about how, despite how her mom would dress up in her overalls, whatnot, she looked very pretty, and she was like a gorgeous lady. And then it starts talking about more into the future about how he would end up going to some car mechanic shop when he was younger, on six or whatnot, to you know, fix parts with the his mom's car or whatever it was. And he ended up meeting another character called Abel. And this Abel character was sort of described as being a bit lean muscular, could, you know, carry a lot of things. And that he had a sort of attractiveness to him. That was also kind of ugly. So it was basically described as being handsome, but not necessarily pretty, I guess. So then the story sort of continues talking about how this Abel character would end up marrying his mother. But they never really got into a big wedding or ceremony or the like, they basically just went in, signed some papers to make the wedding sort of official. And that was pretty much it. And he would basically give birth, I mean, she would basically give birth to a son called Andrew when he was about nine or whatnot. So when his brother was born, he didn't really care too much because he was nine years old or whatnot, and was basically spending his time off playing arcade games and not really caring for the responsibilities of a newborn and whatnot. So he basically just did whatever he kind of felt like, and one day, he pretty much ended up getting a phone call explaining how his mother has been shot by, he got the phone call by Andrew, his brother, so he he sort of wakes up and he's like, whoa, slow down, like, you know, I'm sleeping as his brother asks, Are you busy? What are you doing? sort of thing before explaining that his mom got shot. So the story kind of shifts into sort of intrigue as if like, there's something really suspicious about this. So, for instance, why would you first open off with a How are you doing? Are you busy? If it's like utmost needed emergency, why would you sort of just ask for stuff like that. So there's a lot of doubt and suspicion in the main character's mind. And the second part of that was sort of just the comment, Mom has been shot. So that sort of implied that, you know, maybe this was Abel's doing because he never really gave details about the description of the the event that occurred. So there's a lot of doubt and intrigue going on in his mind. And his brother remained very stoic and calm in saying this. So this, this was a lot of doubt and suspense. But anyways, his, the main character jumps out of bed, tells his roommate or whoever he was with that he needs to go to the hospital right away, because his mom has been shot. So he jumps into the car. And they slammed the gas and start going to the hospital. And on the way to the hospital, he decides to call his brother again, for more context about what happened. So he calls his brother. And his brother perfectly stoic, again, sort of explains more of the details that happened, he explains that it was able who shot his his mother, how they're coming back from church on Sunday, and they got into the car or whatever, and he ended up just shooting and he shot her in the leg. So the main character felt sort of relief after hearing that fact. And then the brother then continues to proceed saying, and then he got shot in the head, she got shot in the head. At that point on, everything just floods in for him, he ends up getting slapped in the face with reality. And that breath of relief he just had from being shot in the leg has been completely washed over with pain and agony. He explains how he just sat there motionless, remembering even the stoplight that it happened at where he was bawling and bawling his eyes out that he cried so much that it didn't even matter for any other time he cried before, that the pain was just so immense, that if he could look back at his past selves, and compare it to his crying self now, they'd basically just say, like, you know, all this nonsense that you cried about in the past, whatever it was, nothing was really worth crying for a man. Like you don't know, true pain. Until now. Basically, he explained how if him and his mom for like a pair to him and her versus the world, and how, as soon as hearing that news that basically cut them down in half, right down the middle. So he felt absolutely devastated, and felt pain and anger. And it wasn't like a cry of sadness, or whatever. But it was like a primal emotion from all the pain. But he had to sort of kind of suck it up and get to himself thinking, you know, just get to the hospital no matter what, even though he's like, breaking down crying. So he gets to the hospital. He meets his brother who has been stoic this entire time. But as soon as his brother season, his brother starts, Andrew starts to break down crying and bawling as if he's been holding it in until this very moment. And from that point on, his brother hugs him and they sort of reassure each other. He then goes up to see his mom and the doctors sort of taller. You know, she's stable, go home for now or whatever, and see her when you can. So anxiously he sort of waits and comes in after some time. And he basically sets by her bed holding his hand her hand and waits for her to wake up with her unbandaged eye. And once she finally does, she sort of tells them Why are you crying like Don't be upset as the main character starts bawling his eyes out. As he was contemplating and questioning what on earth did my mother do to receive this she was the most devout Christian ever, but now God is even betraying her sort of thing, where he questioned the world questioned philosophy and his religion and what everything really ever mattered and even having thoughts about killing Abel when
