This story is told by Trevor and it is mostly about his mother and the tragic incident that happened to her. So he starts the story talking about when he first got his hair cornrowed and how he felt that he looks so much better and how apparently like girls would seem to look to seem to be more interested in him and he just looked a lot better. And he contrasted while he compared himself now to his mother, who only gets herself done for church every once a week, where now he does this every day, and his mother would joke about how he looks the best in the family most days. But on Sunday, it's her that looks the best. And he has a lot of good memories of her being very funny and tearful and very confident. He mentioned that when he was about six. He, their Volkswagen would break down a lot, which would bring them to the local car repair shop. And how, since it would break down a lot, he would go there, uh, he and his mother would go there a lot. And to the point where it would become them going there just to go there. This was because his mother star-, I guess, became interested in one of the repair people named Abel. And eventually, when he was nine years old, his mother and Abel got married. And it is revealed later in his story that Abel wasn't a very good person. But either way, he that's the same year that they got married, I believe. He also they also had another child named Andrew. And this, so they were nine years apart. Eventually, Trevor ended up well he grew up, and he became a comedian. He still lived locally in their city in South Africa. But yeah, he was just living. And was an adult now on his own. One day, his younger brother Andrew called, and he was very calm. He asked if he was busy. And then he revealed that his mother had been shot. So Andrew quickly got up and he called one of his friends or whoever was with him to also come and told him, told them that his mother was shot and that they have to go and so they went and Trevor was still talking to Andrew. And on the phone oh and so he was going to meet his well to see, to meet Andrew and see his mother at the hospital. And so he got into the car and he was going and he's still talking to Andrew. And Andrew told him that he that she got so when he asked how, where she got shot, or how it happened. He described that it happened when they came back from church. And Abel was upset and he started shooting and shot shooting everywhere and shot their mother in the leg and in the head. And when Trevor heard that she got shot in the head, he was devastated and he started crying. He describes that he started crying more than he ever had before and that it made everything else that he ever cried about seem like just trival matters in comparison. And yes, it was very, very tragic for him eventually, but he still told himself while he just has to get to the hospital to see her. At this point, he thought that she was dead or going to die. He when He sees Andrew in the hospital his little brother. Andrew is still a bit sitting there stoically calmly that we as blood smeared on him. And as soon as they see each other, Andrew then starts to cry, as if he's been holding it in for now for the whole time until then, Trevor hugs his little brother and they cried together, Trevor notes that their crying was different. While Trevor describes his crying as just imm-, like, immense pain. He just he describes his brother's cry as being one of helplessness. So he sees his mother and she is looking more weak and and frail and just worse than he's ever seen her before. She has bandages on the back of her head and over an eye. And she's in bed in the intensive care unit. She is sedated. The people working there, tell them to go home since there's nothing they can really do. She's not going to wake up anytime soon. And so they go home and sleep. When they when Trevor comes back and sees her in the hospital. She wakes up eventually and opens up her eye, the one that's not bandaged and Trevor starts crying. The mother drink some water with a straw. And I'll tell them to stop crying and that it's okay. And Trevor just says that Oh, I thought you're going to going to die. And she's like No. And it was very intense for the two of them. Though the tension was broken when the mother comments that he's now the best looking one in the family. And they she smiles and he starts laughing with her. And that's the story, though. I'll add that. Also before she woke up. He remembers thinking that he should that he wished that he would have killed Abel before he was able to do such a thing to his mother. He was really mad at Abel and all the things that he did. He wishes that the police arrested him long ago. Though, he knows that he couldn't have killed Abel himself but he was so upset and angry with him that he wishes that he did
