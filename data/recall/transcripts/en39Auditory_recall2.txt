The story starts off with the main character, Trevor, talking about how he got cornrows into his hair for a play, and he started attracting girls, and he started feeling better about himself because he was attracting girls. And so he used to go back every like he used to go back periodically, sit for hours on end in the salon, I think, six to seven hours, four to six hours, getting his hair straightened and then put into cornrows. And his mother used to make fun of him and say, I would never date a guy who spent more time on his hair than I did. And they would, she would taunt him like that. And he said that her mother sorry. His mother used to dress, as he put it, like a homeless person, just dressed like regular clothes, hair, messy, working in the garden all five days of the week from Monday to Friday, Monday to Saturday, six days of the week, Monday Saturday, and then on Sundays for church, she would take a shower and put on her best clothes and put on high heels, and she would look like the previous person, And then her then his mother would say, Look at me, I just had to take a shower to look this pretty, and you have spent hours at the salon just to look half as good as I do. I hope you enjoyed having your six days being the prettiest person, because now I'm here, and as she says, The Queen is back baby. So he talks about his mother, his childhood, and how there were only two men in her lives, in her in her mother, in his mother's life, two or two of the more significant ones, one was his birth father, and one was his stepfather. And then he mentioned the story of his stepfather and how. So their car used to break down a lot, and so they'd go to the auto shop close to his father's house, his birth father's house, and he met the.
