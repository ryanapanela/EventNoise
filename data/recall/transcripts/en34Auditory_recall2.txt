Okay, so in this story, it was in Africa during the apartheid. And there is a mom and a boy, who was, I guess it was Kevin, but I can't remember how old he is like seven, eight, something like that. And then the younger brother Andrew, and they went to leave, and they went to get in the car and their car wouldn't start. So then they decided that they were going to take, oh, my voice sounds better like this. They decided that they were going to take like public transit, but they weren't allowed to because they were black. So then they had to wait for the mini bus, which was a bus route operated by black people. But they were really unreliable because they didn't always they didn't always come on time because they weren't like like, we weren't like a public system. So like they weren't set up to like come at regular intervals and people just kind of what they wanted. And then so then they got this like random person on the side of the road to pick them up. So then he started driving with him. And then oh oh oh, the beginning the beginning of the story, it was the narrator was like, I always saw people getting hurled out of vehicles in the in the movies, but it's nothing like like basically like Hollywood like makes it seem a lot more fun than it actually isn't. It's actually like scary and dangerous. Then they go, and they so they went with this guy who was nice enough to pick them up. And then one of the or two guys that operate the minibuses saw him and then got mad that they were taking his clientele, which is what they had said earlier, too, that people who drove the minibuses would get mad if other people took like, took their stuff, because I guess then they don't get the money for it. And then they both took like clubs and started beating the guy up. And then the narrator's mom was like, Oh, wait, it's Don't Don't do that to him. Like we wanted to take your bus, but we couldn't. Because you didn't show up. So then they got out of this guy's car and then went with him. And then I guess they're the mom and the guy who's driving the bus, like from opposite tribes can't remember their names. So then he like, started calling her a slut. And then said something like that implied that he was going to kill them or like that she had to pay for what she did. Because she had two kids. And one of them was mixed. And then the like, I guess narrator was nodding off in the back seat. And then oh, and then the guy was like driving like crazy. And then she said when he would, she said to the kid, like when when he slows down, we're gonna go out. We're gonna, like, try and escape above the bus. And he was asleep. So you didn't hear. So then when the driver slowed down, she opened the door and like, threw her kid out. And then she had the baby, and then they like, tuck and roll down. And then she just yelled at him to like, run. Then they ran. And he just had like the adrenaline kicked in, and they're just running to a petrol station. And then from there, they called the police. And I guess the guy, the guys who were in the bus, like went to follow up but couldn't catch up because they were running so fast. And then, yeah, I guess it was just that you said the adrenaline kicked in, because he was like, covered in scrapes and stuff. And then the mom was saying, Oh, well, you know, you can thank God for the fact that we're safe. And then the kid was like, No, God or Jesus was telling you to stay at when the car wouldn't start this morning.This was the work of the devil. And then we went back and forth a bit more than he said next time. Can you ask Jesus to meet us at our house because this day was too much.
