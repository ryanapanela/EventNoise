So the narrator starts off by recalling how when he was just a kid, he got cornrows in his hair. And it seemed like the girls liked it like in his neighborhood. And so he would always get cornrows and you spent so much time you know, making his hair like this, and his mom teased him for it. Because he spent, like, just as much time as, you know, a female might spend on their appearance. And his mom was a pretty simple woman. She works Monday to Friday, and then after work, she'd be in the garden, you know, wearing very casual clothes. You know, very, not slo- too sloppy, but you know, very relaxed. And then when Sunday would come, she would get all dressed up for church, and she would look like a million bucks. And on these days, she would tease him saying, you know, he spends so much time on his appearance when she could just get out of the shower and look like she did. And his mother or sorry they happen to, her, their, their family had a lot of car problems growing up as well. So they would also visit the mechanic frequently. This guy named Abel, and you know, I, he, the narrator describes his mother as a very beautiful woman. And he shared that she's broken a few hearts in her days. But since he was born, there were only two men in her life. One was the narrator's father, and his stepfather, which would be Abel, eventually. Because, you know, visiting, the mechanic came to the point where it's sometimes they would go to the auto shop, when there weren't even car problems. And then suddenly, Abel was sort of in their life. And not too long after the narrator Trevor had a younger brother, who's about nine years younger than him. And, you know, it didn't make any difference to Trevor. He's just a kid growing up. So you know, he could do the things he'd want to do. He didn't have to have any responsibilities to help take care of his brother, like changing diapers. So he went about his way. And, you know, as he grew up, he pursued his passion, Trevor of, you know, being a comedian, yet. He was touring. And so you know, he was away from his family. He was in England and other places. And so one day, he gets a call early in the morning from his brother, his younger brother, and his brother is very calm. And he asked Trevor how he is, you know, if he's busy. And Trevor just replies, he's sort of in the middle of sleeping. And, you know, he asked what's up? And his brother very calmly, explains that his mother has been shot. And Trevor's in disbelief, and several thoughts are running through his head, like, you know, if that's the news I had to deliver, then, you know, I would have said it right off the bat, instead of, you know, trying to ask how someone is or if they're busy. And so Trevor's first thought is that maybe his brother or no Abel, like, the stepfather had shot his mother, which later turns out to be true. And so, Trevor asked his brother where his mom or their mom is, and so he explains which hospital they're at. And so he rushes on over. And he, I think Trevor gets his buddy to also go with him. And, you know, tell him the situation and they go off to the hospital together. And so while at a stoplight, either he well he contacts his brother again, and sort of asked for more details, and his brother explains that they had just left the church, and I think they're getting home. And Abel was, you know, outside and he had a gun and he was shooting everywhere. And so Trevor ask where his mother got shot. And his brother explains in the leg, and to Trevor for a moment is relieved, he's like, okay, so she'll be okay. And then his brother explains that she also had been shot in the head. And at that point Trevor had broken down, you know, while at this traffic light crying. And he felt immense pain and sort of anger. He felt this sort of pain that he could only express through crying but he but the pain was greater, and then crying. He sort of felt it all throughout. And the traffic light turn green, he just had to keep going. He knew he had to, just tried to make it to the hospital to see his mom. And while talking to his brother, his brother still calm, oddly enough. And so they finally get to the hospital. And his brother's waiting outside in this waiting area, and when he sees Trevor he finally breaks down crying as well. But Trevor describes his brothers crying as sort of a different type of crying. It's not from pain, but I can't quite remember what how he describes it. But you know, his brother was just trying to hold all together until his, Trevor can make it to the hospital. And so they go in. And they try to see the their mother. But the doctor explains that she's been sedated. And she's in stable condition. And they tell them to go home because there's nothing that they can do at that point. And the doctors tell them to go rest and sleep. And so they do. And the next day Trevor visits his mom. And he sees that her head has been bandaged. And she's asleep at this point. So he's just sitting there and waiting for her to wake up. And when she does, she asked for a cup of water and he gets for him. or he gets it for her, and she slowly takes a sip. And while he she does, he's crying and bawling his eyes out. And his mother's trying to reassure him and comfort him, telling him not to cry. And he says, I can't, like stop crying. He's, he's very angry at this moment. He's angry at, you know? Abel his stepfather. He's angry at God because, you know, why would you know he let this happen? His mother is a very religious person. And you know, she prays every day
