John Bolo was named after some famous character and Bruce Lee was Bruce Lee and speaker was like thank Jesus it's Bruce Lee and Bruce Lee was just like the actor he was good looking built and then John is just a regular John which the speaker says it's weird because of the contrast between John and the other two Chinese guys so Bolo was into the pirating business his parents were both their occupation were pirates so that's where Bolo picked up that trade and he would be pirating different CDs and would be selling them at school and Bolo had access to a wide resource pool so whatever the people at the school wanted he could get that for them and Bolo was working with this guy named Andrew and one day Trevor overheard a conversation between Bolo and Andrew complaining about black people because sometimes they would order stuff from Bolo say that they will pay a him later but never actually give him the money and Bolo was scared of these black people to ask them to pay up So Trevor had an idea.
