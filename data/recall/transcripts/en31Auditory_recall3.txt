When Trevor was in high school, he got cornrows for a party or a school dance. And he thought it made him look better and girls were more attracted to him. He wasn't sure if they liked it, or if they appreciated the fact that he got his hair done. He remembers going to the salon, the same salon and sitting there for four hours while they straighten and put his hair in cornrows. His mom would make fun of him and be like, Who would ever date someone or love someone who does so much with their hair. He remembers his mom like during the week she would go to work, she work in the garden, she would look homeless during the week. But for Sunday's, she would do her hair, put on a nice dress and heels for church. And then she would tease him saying that I'm saying that she was the best looking person in the family. And two of them would just tease each other like that because it was the two of them. There were two men in his mom's life, his father and his stepfather. There was a garage near their house. And when their Volkswagen broke down, they would go to the garage to get it fixed. There was a man named Abel who worked there. They would keep going to the garage every time their car broke down, and then also got to a point where they started going there regardless. And then Trevor realized that this guy is now part of his life. He was tall, lanky, able to like lift a car engine out. And he made his mom happy. They got married, and they had another son. And Trevor remembers just a few days where the mom was gone. And it came back with the new his new baby brother. And then time went on. Trevor's left to do like comedy work. And like travel as he became a comedian. One night when he was sleeping, he gets a call. And it's his brother, it his mom's number flashing on his phone. But when he answers it's his brother on the line. He remembers his brother being super calm, not crying or anything. And just saying, "Hey, how are you?" Trevor's like "I'm good". Brother's like, "are you busy?". Trevor's like "I'm about to go to sleep. What's up?"  And his brother just said, "Mom has been shot". And Trevor, two things that confused him about this like one Why was his brother so calm? When saying that? Why would if your mother has been shot? Why would you not just start the phone conversation with? She's been shot rather than how are you? What are you doing? And the second thing is he didn't even have to ask who shot her because he knew Abel shot his mom. So he's like, "Okay, where are you guys" and the brother said that they're at the hospital. And then Trevor's like, "Okay, I'm coming", jumped out of bed, ran down the hall, to wherever his friend was staying. And said, "Oh, my God, my mom has been shot, we gotta go". So the two of them get into the car and start driving to the hospital, which is thankfully only like 15 minutes away. While they're in the car Trevor calls his brother again. And just to check up and say like, "what what happened". And then his brother was like, "we were on our way back from church, and Abel was waiting for us at home. We pulled up the car and then Abel just start shooting". And he shot mom in the leg. And at that point, Trevor was like, Oh my God, thank God just the leg, she's gonna be fine. And then he continued and was like, "and in the head". When he said that Trevor started bawling just broke down collapsed in the car. And he said he remembers the exact traffic light where it happened. There was these, he cried, like, never cried before, to the point where if other past crying selves of him could go back in time and see the way he was crying, then there'll be like, that's not something to cry about because the cries that he was having at that moment. Were just so emotional, so raw. He said that, that type of crying was just it was not catharsis, it was not anything like that. It was just raw pain and the body could not deal with that pain. So that was just the way it came out. So they through his cries he manages to drive and get to the hospital. When he gets there, his brother is waiting outside the emergency. Then he sees his brother like covered in blood. And as soon as he steps out of the car, his brother also starts crying as if he's been holding it in all day and he just stood there holding his brother while his brother cried, different type of crying, but still bawling nonetheless. Then Trevor goes into hospital and the doctors kept her sedated for two days, while her body recovers, and told them to go home for the night and to come back. So Trevor came back in the morning and sat beside his mom. His mom had the back of her head was bandaged, her nose and left eye were also bandaged and covered up. So Trevor just sat there thinking and was like kind of angry with himself for not being there, angry with God kind of thought like I should have. He was angry with the police, or all the times the Police hadn't intervened in the past. He thought he should have killed Abel in the past, but then which is just crazy because he would never kill somebody. And then after I think, like an hour or so, his mom kind of woke up, opened her eyes. And then the moment she opened her eyes, he started bawling and uncontrollably sobbing again. And then she asked for some water. While still crying. He like gave her the water. She leaned forward to take a sip. Trevor's still crying his eyes out, and she is like "shh don't worry, don't. I'm fine. Don't cry. I didn't die". Trevor's Iike "I thought you were gonna die. I thought you were dead. What do you mean? You're fine", blah, blah. She's like, "don't worry. Don't worry. Look at me. Listen. At least you're the best looking in the family now", as a joke, and then Trevor, or she started laughing. And then while still crying Trevor also started laughing and the two of them were just sitting there, I guess laughing in the hospital. Yeah,
