Trevor, in the beginning kind of described how the transportation system works within South Africa often is kind of unregulated. So it's not regulated by the government, but rather kind of these small kind of crime organizations, and often describing how all it takes is that each route is kind of overseen by a particular kind of crime group. And if another group uses the route of another crime, often the driver will be shot or killed. But pretty much it, Trevor then further describes how his mother Trevor and his brother Andrew, were all entering kind of a taxi or independent driver, in order to get somewhere. But they used kind of taxi service just because their car was broken down. They entered the vehicle. However, a car swept up in front of the car. And pretty much someone came out of that vehicle and started yelling at the drivers, why did you take my customers. Trevor and his mom, and brothers decided to just okay, we'll go to the minibus, and we'll use your service, because that was what they originally intended. They entered the vehicle. And the minibus driver was quite rude, or disrespectful, rather to Trevor's mother, just because of the differences between two types of woman. Trevor was describing how there's certain characteristics between two woman's in which one's more, docile, kind of will accept everything will do anything that has asked of them while the other type of woman which is kind of the stereotype characteristics of what Trevor's mother is, is kind of more assertive. And he was pretty much insulting Trevor's mother, and he wouldn't stop the car. So Trevor's mom told Trevor, that once the driver eventually kind of slows down, especially during the intersection, check the traffic, that they should jump out of the car. Trevor was kind of falling asleep at that point. But they jumped out of the vehicle. The mom pushed Trevor out the door, and the mother grabbed Andrew. And then she also rolled off out of the car. And they kind of ended up at a petrol station. And they were kind of arguing back and forth, in which Trevor was kind of confused and frustrated as to why you got pushed out of the car because he was quite bewildered and quite shocked about it. And described how his mother saved his life just because the mini bus driver was planning on potentially killing them or worst case scenario the mother get may get raped, have all these kind of violent actions potentially happening. And Trevor was also describing how his how it might be an act of God playing against them in which the devil made them made their car not work and thus they had to take the minibus services. But the mother described how that's not the case.
