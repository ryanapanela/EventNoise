So the story begins with the main character, Trevor talking about how he always sort of watched these action Hollywood movies, and you'd see how these characters would do these ridiculous stunt scenes where, while they were driving, they would, you know, just jump out of a car effortlessly and tumble along as if nothing really happened. And they just quickly spring back up out of action, as if they didn't really get seriously injured. And he had to look at that. And always think to himself, you know, this is just sort of ridiculous, who would believe any of this nonsense, and this is like overly dramatic and whatnot. And he thought this until, you know, he explains that one day, he really did get thrown out of the car, like a high speed moving vehicle. So then this is where it brings us to a current point in the story where he describes how, with him and his mother, he's about to go out on an outing. However, when they tried to sort of start up the car, the car wouldn't work. So they're kind of just left, they're stuck at their house. So they're pretty confused and don't know what to do until they decide to sort of take a hike and find another option to sort of get to their destination. At this point, in time, the author starts talking about how he starts discussing the laws of the time, and how in South Africa, everything was sort of under apartheid, and everything was sort of divisionary. And as a consequence of how the laws were laid out, and how the road and the rules were laid out, they didn't get much access to facilities and whatnot. And as a result, they sort of have to come under their own sort of coalition's for, or, you know, just figuring out ways to make things happen themselves for the black community. So as a result, one of the things was that they ended up trying to come up with a sort of improvised idealization of how the bus transit system should work. So each sort of routes under apartheid was for black people controlled by a certain group, so it was all privatized. And as a result, this paved way to a lot of organized crime, because it was basically sort of just each route was controlled by a certain gang. So as a result, they had all the power and leverage of that. And if any other gang would try to cross paths with them, then it would result in serious consequences. And they'd probably fight each other off to the death sort of thing. So it was taken very seriously that you stick to your stick the route stick to your customers. And this was a sort of very deadly thing. So the author explains that, given all this, they ended up having to wait for taking the bus to get to their destination. However, as is with the privatized bus routes, and apartheid, it was very, it was very haphazard because they controlled the power for the routes and whatnot. Buses come when they come and they don't when they don't. So they don't really give a crap for sticking to sort of a certain schedule. They just do whatever they felt like at the time. So as a result, the main character was sitting there, waiting and waiting and waiting for the bus. And he was feeling really, really sleepy. So his mom was just like, Okay, let's take a hike. We'll just start walking at this point. And on their way, they come across kind man who offers them a ride in the car. And the mom says, Sure, we can do that. So him, his mom and his younger brother Andrew hop into the car. And the kind man offers them a ride. However, at some point during the ride, they get caught, cut off by the serving bus that was supposed to pick them up. And at this point on, they, the people from the bus, the gang members, then force the kind bus, the kinda car driver to get out of this car. And they basically take out their weapons. It was like a traditional Zulu weapon and basically, almost clubbed him to death in his face and told his mom had to intervene saying stop that stop that. We just wanted to ride you with. With your bus anyways, we didn't really, you know, that was our main intention. So you don't need to club this guy. To death, he was just being kind and offering a ride. So he convinced them to stop, she convinced them to stop and they would end up joining the bus rider onto his bus. So they hopped on his bus. And the bus driver would then try to, you know, take them to their destination. However, as is with the whole gang member thing, the bus route saw these people sort of did whatever they felt like, and it was very, very dangerous back then. So this guy was very clearly agitated, and very angry sort of person, the bus driver. And there's a lot of stereotypes and whatnot that came into factor here back in back then. So main character would talk about, you know, two, two sort of clans, I guess, for South Africa at the time, there is like the Zulu sort of people who the main character described as being being very, you know, sort of righteous and sort of upright people, I guess. While the other clan which I forgot the name, it starts with a T. Tucien, something like that. They were kind of just like more. I don't know, in the context of woman they were he described the stereotype as being, you know, very promiscuous, or like being very whimsidaical (whimiscal), just not really kind of like aloof, don't really care, just do what they want and very promiscuous. So as a result, when his mom starts raising his voice back at the driver, because she wasn't having any of what he was having, he was being kind of upset, lecturing him, you know, like, Oh, why are you going into the car of another man, when you are just the woman with two child implying that, you know, that's kind of dangerous, and she went back saying. I don't care mind your own business. So there is a bit of snark going between them. And this sort of escalated things. And when the bus driver finds out that he's not, she's not like Zulu, and from the other clan, he mentions that all you know, this sort of explains everything. This explains why you are going out with another man in a car by yourself. And he even called her like you know like slutty, and whatever saying, like, he, she just goes out on whims with other people. And that sort of explains things. And basically, he started reinforcing those stereotypes that these people had of one another back in the day regarding their people. So the mom kind of got upset and whatnot. And basically, things escalated to a point where the driver was like, You know what, tonight, you will learn your lesson. You people will not have your ways. So he got very upset, and he was speeding and speeding and speeding and they kept increasing, you know, his road road rage, not even stopping to really care for traffic, only just making sure he doesn't crash sort of thing, when he's stopping at lights or whatever it was. So the mom was constantly telling him, No, it's okay. You know what sorry if we offended you, my friend, but you can just let us off now. We'll be on our way we can walk. It's fine. But he was always like, no, no, no, you better learn your lesson. The main character at this time is just completely sleep deprived. Trevor didn't really care about, you know, what was going on just like he just needed his sleep. So they sat there in the back of the bus that was completely empty, just saying, you know, please let us off. And at some point, I guess the mom realizes that, you know, this person might have plans to do something really poorly, poorly conceived back then, you know, like, maybe kill or rape her as she would, as the main character would describe were completely completely possible options at this point in time with what was going on.
