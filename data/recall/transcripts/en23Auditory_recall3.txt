Okay, so these three Chinese kids, Asian kids move to Trevor's school. And one of them names something with a bee in the lawn or something. And the other one's name is Bruce Lee. And he's very, like fit and attractive and quiet. And everyone thinks it's great that he's named Bruce Lee. It's like, you know, for the movies. And the third guy's name is genre. He's just Johnny's not important to the story. And so, I'm the first guy, I'm just gonna call him like, Why No, his parents were like pyrometers, like pirating TV, movies and games and stuff. So that's what he did to when he would get, like new Playstations. And you put chips, people's Playstations and then sell them, pirated games for cheap. And so there was this white kid Andrew, who teamed up with that you didn't get to do this. And then one day, Trevor them complaining about the black kids, they would sell too, because they would just tell Andrew and whatnot that like. And he would just pay them back. And they never did. And they knew that they didn't have to, because they would be too scared to go up to the black kids and ask them for their money. And so Trevor, instead of being like really offended by this, he said, You would help them out, and he would be the middleman. And so he would like, get the money from the kids at the school. And so they were doing that, he got to share the profits. And that was going really well. And then the Asian kid had to move away. So Trevor became like a big part bigger part of the operation. He started selling, like music CDs for like $3. And the currency, which is written CDs up like $250. So it was very good deal. And no one would like go back to buying CDs after they did this. And they sold a lot of like American, hip hop and r&b, but also a lot of South African, like, music from the area. Yeah, and then, Trevor, became really good at this. And eventually, he got middlemen, too. And one of them said that he should start selling CDs that were just like, with a bunch of different tracks from different albums on them. And that would sell better. So turbostar doing that, and he made more money. And while this is going on, in general, with all the money he was making, he would like upgrade his setups. He started with dial up internet, and it would take a whole day to download an album. So he kept like upgrading and investing so that he could get through more music. And he would have to listen to every seat as it played through to like, burn it onto the discs. And so, but he didn't really like actively listen to the music, like he didn't really hear it because he knew that dealers should never get high on their supply. So then, yeah, he's selling these CDs are like mixtapes, basically. And then his friend said that he should start fading songs and do each other like a DJ. So he gets like an online DJ program. And he starts doing that as well. And the sell really well. And he had CDs for like different parties and everything made up. And so if this is going really well, and he's making a ton of money, and he buys himself, a portable phone, which is like a big deal in the day, like before, everyone had cell phones, so he could walk two blocks to McDonald's and get a burger and then walk all the way back while still on the phone. Like they put the receiver by the window at his house and like talk to his friends. It's be all cool, this big antenna sticking out of this phone. Yeah, and I guess he was grateful to Andrew like this white kid for helping them out. Kind of like finding this raw business talent for him because otherwise he wouldn't have had any place to use it. And he said that while Andrews people were like preparing for university. The traverse people were like in huts, singing songs to learn multiplication tables. Two times two is four and three times to the six lalala. And so he thought like he didn't see it as taking handouts from Andrew, getting to work with him, but it's like, just an advantage to him. And he brought up the saying of like, Give a man officially for a day and teach a man to fish. he'll eat for a lifetime. But he also pointed that what's missing from that anecdote is the fishing rod like you know may also be nice to give the man a fishing rod so we can actually fish and that's kind of what Andrew did for him like helping them sort out his business skills and giving him experience to find that he was really good at that.
