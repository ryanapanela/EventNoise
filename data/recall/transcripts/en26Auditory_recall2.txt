So before recalling the parts of the story, the only thing I'm going to say is that like there was a lot of background was going on. But yet the parts that I got was, the story was about mother. And I think she had to send one cent or two sounds from what I comprehended. And they were on this road trip. When they were held hostage, they were nabbed by some local unscrupulous people who had subjected them to decrease of violence and other others such as harrassing them on the street when they were driving. So basically, they were like going on their way to Tao. So from what I understood, that they were either on the way to South Africa, to some town or some municipality in South Africa or something like that. And then they were while on their way, they were, like, attacked by a group of people who started harassing them and what not. And then they were, and then they were like, just going to the car and I think they were like being chased after. And then the mother instinctively asked her son to jump from the car, even though the car was speeding, but he was probably sleeping or something. And he wouldn't listen. At least that's what was told, it seems. So the mother had no option, no choice but to throw the son out of the moving car. And as a result, the son got hurt and probably was sore in one of his legs. And then the mother and the son once they were moved to safety, they have started started arguing with each other. They were like, talking about the potential danger danger that they were subjected to and the and the repercussions that would have happened as a result, and the sun was like stating his fact that he was being rational rational, while the mother stated otherwise as well stating that I should have left you in the car to let those guys kill you. So the story ended. Overall, the story ended in an argument between the mother and son
