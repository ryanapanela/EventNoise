Okay, so the story starts with him describing. Something about either him or someone else being a good looking guy how he got his hair done for a couple of hours or something. And then his when he went to tell his mom,his mom was like, like, you need like four hours to get your hair done. And I'm I don't know, beautiful as is or something like that. And then he talks about how his mom isn't attractive. Wait. Yeah isn't attractive. Like, woman Haha, that's like weird for him to say, but she like exudes this confidence, even when she's like out in the garden, or whatever, she still is like, very beautiful, or something. And he talks about how he her his mom was married twice, first to his dad and then to his stepdad. And then later, his brother Andrew was born. He talks about his mom's second husband, the stepdad being a mechanic or something or working at a garage. Gets a garage. Yeah. So he would go and visit the garage, I guess like as a kid, and then eventually teach us like became his dad. He talks about how his stepdad is wasn't that good looking was a nice guy, but not that good looking and how his mom says that women have like a like they don't basically like medium ugly guys. Something like that. Yeah, and so I guess, then he talks about his brother, Andrew for a little bit. I forget what he said about that. But then something about how his stepdad or his brother called him one day, and his mom was shot. In the, I forget what he said, like the leg and then the head. And he was going to the hospital. And I think it was his dad that did it. Or his dad that told them something like something about his dad. And then he was going to the hospital and he felt like crying. And like it was like the worst thing he ever felt or something like that. Then what then he gets to the hospital. His brother's there. His brother's also crying, but they're crying for different reasons. Then they the doctor tells them to go home, because there's nothing they can do. His mom has like hooked up to all these machines, but she's alive. And he had thought she was dead. And then they come back in the morning. And his mom was still asleep but I think she wakes up and then he's crying and he's like a, his mom is telling him not to cry. And he's saying he thought that she was dead. And he's and she's saying well if I die then you'll be like the better looking one you'll finally be the best looking one in the family or something like that. And then they laugh and then something else that I couldn't hear yeah yeah.
