During that back and forth discussion Trevor mentions his mum said it just listened should of just stayed home and listen to the voice that if there was no many of us that shouldn't have gone out so that they would they could have potentially avoided this whole ordeal so just like in any ordinary Sunday speaker was having porridge at home prepared by his mum and he has a baby brother Andrew nine months old that mum was getting that baby boy dressed and they were about to go out when they got to the car they realized it wouldn't start and so they had to find another means of transportation and in South Africa due to the apartheid there are so many bus routes that are unregulated so buses can come whenever or not come at all and the speaker Trevor mum and the baby boy they decided to wait for one of these mini buses and they were waiting for a long time no bus came and before they board the bus he talks about the network of these mini buses because there are many groups of people who run these mini buses and there they all have their own bus routes and they don't want anyone stealing their bus or driving on their their bus routes. And people pay large sums of money to travel on these unregulated mini bus routes because the transportation is unreliable and these mini buses are unregulated once they are also an unreliable and they're run by often these gangs. So on this Sunday, these speaker mum and baby boy, they're they're waiting for a minibus, none comes in. Eventually there's a driver in a small car that slows down and, and this family gets on hops into this unknown man's car and takes them traveling to the direction that they need to go. But then all of a sudden, there was one of these mini buses that passes over into their lane and stops in front of them. And then out from the mini bus comes these these men carrying and Iwisa, a Zulu weapon that could potentially be used to bash people's skulls with so you have these men with these weapons. They come out they go to the driver's side of this car, opens the door pulls out the man and then start yelling at him like why are you stealing our customers and they also were beating these men were beating this driver with that Zulu, Zulu weapon then the speaker's mother speaks up and says hey, this man was just trying to help us and mother was like okay, I was gonna get on one of these mini buses so I'll get on that mini bus your mini bus now. That's what they did these the three people speaker mother and baby boy they went on that mini bus and they started traveling often on these mini buses these drivers in South Africa they don't ride quietly they are they always have something to say to the passengers and sometimes it can be very strongly worded and in this particular instance they're here and in South Africa there are two groups of people there are Zulu and Xhosa and the Zulu people are considered how have like a more positive connotation to this group of people, while the Xhosa especially the Xhosa women were perceived to be promiscuous and like a slut and the driver knew the mother was Xhosa based on the way she was speaking like the, the language that she was using. And so this driver starts yelling at her and berating her, calling her all sorts of names. But the speaker's mom was used to it. She doesn't let people lecture her like that. She stands up for herself.
