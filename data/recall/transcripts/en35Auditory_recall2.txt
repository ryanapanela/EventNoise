So the story is narrated by a son and his life. He The story starts with him saying that he got cornrows. And then he started getting dates with girls. And he thought that it's because he either looked better or women liked the fact that he was also going through as much as pain as they did to look beautiful. And then he said that his mom didn't like the cornrows and his mom said that she would never go out with a man who put so much effort into looking pretty. And he said that his mom would spend like hours getting ready. And on Sundays, his mom was really, like really religious. And on Sunday, she would go to church and she would get ready she would wear heels she would wear. I think red lipstick, I'm not too sure. And she will look gorgeous. And his mom would be like, even despite the cornrows even despite how many hours you put into your, into your look, you're still not as good looking as me, you're still not the best looking person in the family. And that was sort of an inside running joke that they had. And she would say that, Oh, look, it takes you hours to get ready. All I do is I take a shower, and I look so beautiful. And then he he would just laugh about that. And he said that. I know she was joking because no matter no son wants to talk about how hot his mother is. But then he said that, but it is true that my mom was attractive. And he said that I'm sure that my mom broke a lot of hearts in the back in the day. But after I was born, like throughout my life, there's only been two men in her life. One was my father and one was my stepfather. They met the stepfather his name was Abel they met him at oh also the son's name is Trevor, and the stepfather's name is Abel. So they met the stepfather at I think at an auto repair shop nearby their house where the son and then his mother's like their volkswagon will break down all the time. So the mother would take it to the repair shop like the mechanic shop to get fixed. And over there. They met this mechanic called Abel and they got to talking and he was really charming, and he was really nice, and he will fix our cars. And then over time, him and his mother got married. And they were all like living together. And I think the time that they she got married to the stepfather Trevor was eight years old. And then a year later, they had a son, his name was Andrew. And he said that it was really interesting to him that the way he worded was like, because as a child, he didn't understand a lot of things. He said that it was really interesting that he you know, he was there with the stepfather and his mom and then his mom went away for a couple of days. And when she came back there was this little thing in that house that he didn't really know what to do with. And he said that it's it's different. When you're so much like you're nine years older than your sibling, your it doesn't really change your life that much because you're like so far removed from them. And skip to a couple of years later, like he's all older now he moved out he was on track to become a comedian. He was selling out shows he was doing, like, you know, like these like stand up comedy shows and stuff like that. And I think he was said that he was doing radio show like talk shows. And he was also going to London and stuff to do that. And then that was just a bit about his life. And then it gets to him being in a hotel room for one of his comedy talk shows or something like that. I think it was a hotel room. I'm not too sure. And he gets a call. It's like 9am He gets a call from his brother Andrew. And then he picks up the call and then Andrew goes like, Hey, how are you? And Trevor goes, like, I'm good. How are you? And Andrew says I'm good. Are you busy? And Trevor says that? Yeah, I was kind of sleeping but what's up? And then Andrew says, Mom has been shot. And Trevor was really shaken up about the fact that first of all, why is Andrew calling me with such grave news and spending his time asking me questions like how are you and are you busy? Like he said that? If your mom has been shot, the first thing you do when you pick up the call is say mom has been shot you don't ask how are you and are you busy? Why would he ask me if I'm busy? And he also said that it also struck me that he is very calm. Like Andrew is very calm. He wasn't panicked. So then Trevor asked Andrew like what happened? And then he said, Where are you guys? And he said that we're in the Wilkins field hospital. I think there was something field hospital and driver said that he didn't have to ask How had she been shot because he could fill in the blanks on his own that Abel shot mom. And he said that he was glad that they were at that hospital because it was only a 15 minute drive from where he was at. So he said, Okay, fine, I'll be there soon. Then he runs down the hallway to pick up his friend. And he tells him like, he bangs on his door, and he says, wake up, we need to go. My mom has been shot. And then he says that his friend also jumped out of the bed, just as Trevor had jumped out of the bed. And then they get into car and they're, they're going. And he says that because Andrew was so calm on the phone. He was also feeling a little bit calm, because he thought that because he's so calm. I'm sure everything's under control, and it's nothing serious. And then he calls back Andrew on the phone to ask him more information. And he says that, what happened? Where has she been shot? And Andrew says that Andrew says that his mom and Andrew were coming back from church on Sunday morning. And Abel had been like when they got back to the house and they got out of the car. Abel came out of the house and started shooting things. And then he shot mom. And then Trevor asks him where, and then Andrew says that Abel shot her mom on her leg, and then Trevor feels really relieved. He's like, okay, that's fine. That's okay, that's not too bad. And then after a pause, Andrew says, and then he shot her on the head. And that's when Trevor sort of Trevor says that he felt a vacuum of silence, and he felt his body give out, I think, and he just, he felt like he said that he started crying and bawling really, really loudly and really painfully. And he said that it wasn't a cry of sight of sadness, or of catharsis or for feeling sorry for himself. But it was a cry of pure raw pain. And it was the pain and the level of crying that he had never experienced before. And it was as if everything that he had ever cried for in his life. I think he lost all of that at once. That's why he was crying that hard. And he said that the level that he was crying at it was like, if his current crying self will look at his past crying selves. He will say that this is not worth crying about whatever you're crying about, because this huge thing has happened in your life. And then he said that he remembered exactly what traffic light. He was like, he remembered exactly what he like he felt like in that moment, and then the traffic light turned green. And he had to keep driving. And he didn't even know how to, like, continue. But he said that I just have to drive through this pain and just get there. And he kept repeating to himself that just get there just get there and then he finally gets to the hospital. He runs to the emergency room area, and he sees Andrew over there. And Andrew is still standing there perfectly calm. Which takes Trevor, weirdly because he said, Why is he so calm. And then he said that the moment Andrew saw Trevor, he finally broke down and he started crying a lot. And then Trevor ran to him in trouble hug Andrew. And then. And then he said there but Andrew's cries were different from Trevor's cries. They weren't a raw pain, where it was more a feeling of complete helplessness. And then they're just crying. And then they speak to the doctor. And the doctor says that she's in a stable condition, but she's inside in, in the ER, and that two kids should go back home, because they can't do anything at night. They can't really do anything for her, but she's stable and they can come back in the morning. So the two of them go back home and go to sleep. And then Trevor says the first thing in the morning, I came back to the hospital and I'm standing next I'm sitting next to her in the hospital. And the back of her head was bandaged. She has stitches and she had a lot of bandages and stuff on her like faith and having her like one of her eyes was also stitched up and her nose too was all stitched up are all messed up. And then he was just reflecting on how he was so angry that he was angry at everything. He was angry at himself for not being there. He was angry at the police for not arresting Abel, all in the past and he was angry at God because his mother was he said that his mother was super religious. He said that if Jesus had a fanclub, then she would at least be in the top 100 because she was so religious. And this is the thanks that she gets out of all the dedication. Yeah, I think that's all that he was angry at. And he was just really stressed abou that. And then she finally opened one of her eyes like the eye that was not stitched up. And then she asked for water and then he gave and then the moment she woke up. He started crying, like bawling again, and then he gave her some water and then she lifted a little bit up to take the water in from the straw. And then yeah, and then he was just crying and then she was like, Oh, don't cry and then he was like, How can I not cry? And she was a look at the bright side and then I Um, he said that you've been shot in the face, there is no bright side to all of this. And then she said that, well, look at the bright side, at least now you're actually the prettiest looking person in the family. And then she, and then he was like, I think he started laughing a bit. And then she also started laughing a lot. And then the two of them were just laughing. And he said that that's my mom and I, that's what we've always been just the two of us. And we were always, like, laughing through the pain and just trying to, you know, make our way through or something. And I think that's where the story ends. And also, when he's in the car driving to the hospital, I think he's saying that it's always been my mom and me, it's just been us, like, she's my teammate. She's my, you know, like, she's my support person. And it's always been her and I against the world. So when I heard that, when he heard that she's got shot on her on her head, she he while he was crying, he was just really worried about losing that and everything. And so he repeats that sentiment. When she finally wakes up that I thought I was going to lose you. I thought your dead I thought I lost you. And then she said that I wasn't going to die. I wasn't going to die. I knew I was going to die. And then they like she cracks the joke that he's finally the prettiest person in the family and then they start laughing and then that's where the story ends.
