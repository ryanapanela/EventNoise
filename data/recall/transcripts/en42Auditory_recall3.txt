Yeah. So the story begins with Trevor elaborating on why he thinks that action movies and like how the main character rolls out of a car and is fine, why he thinks that's wrong. There was some talk about the transportation in South Africa, which is similar to organized crime in that there are these mini busses who take people places, and it's not sanctioned by the government or anything. And there is some detail which I didn't catch, but and my attention can describe next, they were in a minibus, and then they were not in that minibus, and they were in another minibus, and this the second minibus, like threatened the first minibus to like, hand them over. So I'm not sure if it was, this was a kidnapping originally, or if it became a kidnapping. That part was unclear to me. But the story proceeds. Trevor's mom knows something is wrong. Oh, and it's Trevor baby brother, I think Andrew and the mother in the story, and they're the kids are still both kids, and Andrew is really young, so Andrew's mom whispers like, Hey, we gotta get out. But Trevor couldn't hear this, so he was sleepy, and he gets thrown out at some point by his mother, and then his mother presumably jumps out and like they run, Trevor had to be told to run because he got thrown out of a car while half asleep, so he was understandably confused. But they run, they run, and they get to a 24 hour gas station. At this 24 hour gas station, they they being Trevor's mom and Trevor, they talk a bit about, hey, what was that you just threw me out of the car? And Trevor's mom is very she's like, I told you, but Trevor didn't hear this. So Trevor's mom is like, hey, at least I got you out. Like, should I have just left you there, or something? Like, should I not have thrown you out of the car. And Trevor shoots back with, hey, at least our kidnappers would have woken me up before they killed me, implying that Trevor's mom could have killed Trevor by throwing him out of the car. Yeah. So Trevor is injured. He has, I guess, Road Rash or surface level skin abrasions from being thrown out of the car, and his little brother is fine. Throughout the story, he's fine. He was wrapped up by his mother when she jumped out of the car. And the story may have ended with some overarching conclusion, but that was lost to the conversation of whatever place I was in listening to the story.
