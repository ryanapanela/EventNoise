Okay, so when Trevor was in middle school, I believe three Chinese kids moved in to the school these were the only three kids there. Their names were Bruce Lee, John and Bolo and Bruce Lee was really hilarious to them because it just was really easy joke and he was like super like fit and like good looking and it just like fell into place. John was just John and then Bolo is the important character of the story because his parents had a pirating business where they would pirate CDs and sell them and Bolo naturally took after his parents and join them in the business and he would pirate CDs as well then sell them I don't know if he was pirating CDs actually, but I know he was doing something with the PlayStation he was putting a chip in to make it better to play somehow anyways. So Bolo, hired or partnered with his friend Andrew, who was two years above them. In pirating CDs, Andrew had a CD writer, which was super expensive and like very inaccessible at the time, and basically the key component of the pirating business. And it was, I think, they were complaining one day, Bolo and Andrew about the black kids in the school, ruining their business, because they would take the CDs and then say that they would pay Bolo and Andrew later and they would never pay them. And Bolo and Andrew would never confront them because they were afraid of them. And then Noah was, or sorry, Trevor Noah was listening in on the conversation, and he decided to act as a middleman. And he spoke up and said that, you know, like, you shouldn't be mad at black people, because we don't have a lot of money and trying to get things for less is just what we do. But I can help I can act as a middleman and he worked in a tuck shop. So he had the network. He just needed the supply to be able to like run a business. So the three of them worked together for a little while. And then as Bolo and Andrew graduated, they decided to give it up and then Andrew handed his CD writer down to Trevor and that was like him hitting the jackpot because black people barely had access to computers at the time so a CD writer was like way out of the question. But it this basically set Trevor Noah up for the for handling the business on his own and like expanding it to a larger scale. So he would first start by he would never listen to his own CDs because don't get high on your own supply. But he would never judge anybody's music taste if they asked for Nirvana they he'd give him the latest nirvana. If they asked for DMX, you do the same thing. But he said that while South African, like pop music was popular, what people were really like craving was black American music. So he would be pirating a lot of these albums. And he partnered with two other people, Tom and Milani, I think. And one day Milani told him that what if instead of pirating whole albums, you started pirating the best songs from each CD on to, or best off from each album onto one CD, like a mixtape. Because people only want to listen to their favorites anyways. So he started doing that. And then he downloaded BPM beats per minute, and started mixing the songs so that they would fade in and out of each other and basically doing all the work of a DJ without actually hiring a DJ and making party playlists. And those started taking off quite well. So he was doing really, really well for himself to the point where he was able to buy a wireless big phone before the cell phone time. So he was that guy walking down the street with a giant phone and the like. I think the little antenna like popping all the way out. Just going to McDonald's and the range was like huge so he would be able to like walk around and just be that guy basically. And he this kind of experience would never have been possible if Andrew didn't hand him down the CD writer which kind of like opened his eyes towards the idea of like, I guess, almost like generational wealth, sort of where it's hard for people, like people always say that poor people should like make something of themselves and like pull themselves up by the bootstraps or like, different analogies like if you know, if you teach a man a fish, he'll fish for life. But if you give a man a fish, if you give a man a fish, he'll only have like fish for a day. But if you teach a man to fish, he'll have fish for life. But he said that what they forget to add is that you should also give him a fishing rod. And he said that if, like poor people aren't given the supplies or like the resources to be able to help themselves, like they're not going to be able to get off the ground. It's hard to go somewhere from nothing. And people refer to it as a handout, but you still have to work hard to be able to make something out of yourself using that handout. And that he wouldn't be able to achieve any of what he did without Andrew, giving him the resources to do so.
