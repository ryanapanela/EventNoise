Okay, so the story starts with the guy explaining that there's, there was three kids that started at a school, they were all Asian, John bolo. And Bruce Lee. And everyone was like, Yeah, I guess that they were the only Asian kids like in the school. And then one of them, or there was some guy named Andrew. One of them had like a business or sorry, his parents, like had something where they would like pirate CDs. And so they started this business where they would like copy CDs, and they would sell them to people. But they had an issue where people were like taking the money, or there they were, like saying that they would pay them but then they didn't actually pay them. So this guy, that's the narrator of the story said that he would be like their middleman between the people that were selling like pirating, and like rewriting the CDs, and copying the CDs and the people that were selling them. So he said he was going to be there, like middle guy. And so he started working with them. And then one of them left, I think, and Andrew also left. And so as he was leaving, he like gave him the CD writer, because basically, this guy that the narrator was really good at, like selling stuff, but he didn't have the CD writer, he couldn't like afford one to be able to do this himself. So when Andrew gave him the CD writer, he was able to start copying CDs himself, and selling them to people directly. And then he started doing this so much that he got his own people to help him like with the sales, and they suggested that he not only just copy particular CDs, the whole albums onto new CDs, but they also like they suggested that he also put different songs from different albums onto a particular CD, kind of like a playlist so that they could listen to their own songs. And he said, he was like doing a bunch of different albums for people like Nirvana and like other stuff. And then he started doing this instead. And then someone suggested that he does like fade ins and fade out so that it's more like a DJ. And so he learned to like all the DJ stuff that they typically do with like fading in and fading out the songs. And so that helped his business even more. And he started doing that a lot. And then he ended up like, basically, like, being really big in this like pirating, kind of like DJ CD industry thing so much that he was able to, because at the time, like he couldn't afford a computer, but then he was able to, like actually get a computer and like a phone. And like, like a wireless phones, like he could, like go to McDonald's and stuff, and also be talking to his friends at the same time. And like no one could afford that at the time slot like that was really like a big deal. And he was basically saying that this taught him the importance of like needing more privileged people to help because like, if someone is like underprivileged, then they can't afford the resources that they need to be able to, like make this life for themselves. So even though he's like working hard from the beginning, he needs like a certain amount of resources. And so it's really important for like, other people that have that money and resources to help with that. Because otherwise, it's like really hard to dig yourself out of like, if you're already in like a poor financial situation. And so he just said that that was what he learned from this whole experience.
