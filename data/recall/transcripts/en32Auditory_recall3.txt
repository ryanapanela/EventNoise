Okay, when he was in grade nine, three Chinese boys moved to his school. Bolo, Bruce Lee and John. I can't remember I think Bruce Lee was very funny. And then John was just John. Bolo's parents were professional pirates and pirated CDs. No video games for people and bolo did the same, to a lesser degree in high school and would pirate games and PS two games, I think, specifically for kids in school. And he worked alongside someone else. Can't remember who but they were frustrated, because when they sold to black kids, they would say they're gonna pay them later, and then never did pay them. And they were too scared to ask them for the money. So Trevor overheard them talking about this and said that not to be so hard on the black people because they don't have money to pay for it. But that he would help them and be the middleman and would sell their video games at his shop. And take care of getting the money and he would just get a small portion of the fees in return. And they agreed. And then this worked well. And he began to be able to purchase parts of his computer. From what he was saving. And then he and then Bolo's parents Bolo left school. After a year of doing business with him, they think because his parents got arrested. So he started to work with Andrew. And he had all the parts he needed on his computer, except for a CD writer, but that was too expensive. almost mythical. But then Andrew ended up getting him one. And he was ecstatic because now he could pirate CDs for people. And he started up his business and was selling them for way cheaper than what they were sold for in the stores, which was like 100 150 grand. And he started off with doing full albums. And they would take as long to write the CDs as they did to like play and listen to them. So whole albums. He would come home from school and spend five to six hours making CDs to then sell but it did well, and people stopped buying CDs from actual stores because they could get such a better deal from him. And then he worked with two other people I can't remember their names. But one of them suggested that he make mixtapes rather than just albums on CDs and just pick people's favorite songs. Oh, when people were very desperate for r&b and hip hop, that was very in demand. And so he started to do mixed albums for people with just their favorite songs. And then his friend had another idea where he could have one song lead into the other without a break between the auditory input so that it was kind of like a DJ set at home and he downloaded BPM which was like a graphic interface where he could do that. And his business took off and did very well. And she said it was all thanks to Andrew for giving him the CD writer and some people will look it at as a handout but he still had to work extremely hard to make the profit and make use of the writer and that Andrew was white and he was black and Andrew was given more resources and access education and things that his family would take advantage of that he was not offered as a black person and he brought up the quote that people love to say give a man a fish for a day, he will eat for a day. Teach him to fish and he'll eat for a year but they neglect to say the part about the giving the man the fishing pole.yeah I thinnk that's it.he is forever thankful to Andrew
