African or at least black, starting off explaining how he started to care about as aesthetics and his hair and talking about enjoy getting cornrows because he really liked the attention that he got. So he really appreciated his hair sort of taking care of his hair, going to the hair salon to get his hair straightened and braided every single week, just ro impress people, for themselves to look good. Then he starts to talk about the reaction his mother had. Talking about how his mother would explain how she doesn't really understand men who take such good care of themselves, because she can never really love or fall in love with a man who takes either as much or more care of himself than she does. And the subject talks about how his mother didn't really care about her general aesthetics to begin with in general, I'm talking about how she would really go around the house looking however she wanted to, but only would dress up for church on Sundays, making sure that she got her hair done making sure that her clothes are nice, making sure that she looked good every Sunday just to go to church and people would see. And every single time they went to church, she would talk about how she's the best looking person in the family teasing him talking about how all she needs to do is take a shower, while the subject Trevor needs to do all of that every single week just to keep his hair in place. And then Trevor starts to talk about how his mom really is beautiful, and how they would tease each other for the looks, just a Mother Son teasing. He was talking about how she really was beautiful and how other people really did see that beauty in her. And he said something about her like breaking a few hearts like in her days, he started to talk about how in his life his mom had two partners, or at least two men. That's his biological father and then his stepfather. Trevor didn't really understand why his mother was, he started to talk about how they met, how they met his stepfather. And he talks about how with his father, they would go to the mechanic somewhere on their street. And they would go a lot more frequently talking about how they would go even when there was nothing wrong with the car. And he talks about how through the lens of a child just frequently more and more. And at some point, this man was just in their lives. He mentioned how he didn't really understand why his mother found him attractive or he described him as handsome but not good looking. He quoted his mother's saying, there's like a specific ugly that a man has to be for him to be attractive. He talked about how they had a kid. And as he was growing up, a lot older and older that not more distant but Trevor at least solidifying himself more and more and it was on life, pursuing the career comedy moving to England, finding his place in his own sense of world. And he talks about how one day he gets a call from Andrew saying that his mother was shot. And he's describing his thought process. And he says one you're not an average person would not start, when he answered the phone, he asked them if he was busy. And Trevor describes how a person giving the news to another son that his mother had been shot would not say start the news with if he was busy. And he also goes on to describe how, when he found out that she was shot, he instantly knew that it was Abel, who shot her. And he describes how he leaps out of bed bangs on the door for either his friend or his roommate and they get into the car and start driving to the hospital. And because on the phone, Andrew sounded so calm and composed, he assumes that nothing is wrong with his mother. Andrew calls and he tells him, we're on the phone a second time when he's in the car when he's driving, he stopped at a light and stopped at a red light. And he mentioned how she was shot in the neck. And Trevor has a minor wave of relief. And then Andrew goes on to describe how she was also shot in the head. And Trevor describes how he completely broke down, he started crying in this car still stuck at the red light, utterly defeated, and how there is no other pain he's ever experienced in his entire life that will ever measure up to the pain that he felt in that specific moment. And this is all while they're still at the red light and the light turns green. And in his mind, he's thinking to just get there, just get through it to the hospital. He gets to the hospital, he jumps out of the car. And he sees Andrew waiting. And he's covered in blood. And the whole time Trevor was thinking that Andrew was so calm and composed. And he's very confused by that. But he notices that Andrew saw him and he completely broke down into tears. And he describes how he describes his own tears. But he describes Andrews as a wail of hopelessness. Either Trevor or both of them go into the hospital room to see his mother. And she's there. She's covered in stitches and bandages and gauze. But she's unconscious, and the doctor or the operator tells them that she's fine, she's just asleep. But they tell them that they have no use saying of the hospital. And then they're better off just leaving or getting some sleep and coming back in the morning. That's what they do. Both go home, get some sleep and sharper comes back in the morning to see his mom in the hospital. And she's awake. Either it was the doctor or Trevor or herself but they pull the bandages off her face and seeing the wounds seeing the damage Trevor breaks down into tears again. And his mother asks for a drink of water. He was obviously her obviously upset, but also angry at Abel, angry at the world, angry at their god describing how his mother was very religious and prayed so often that in his words, if there was a list of top 100 list says mum would make top 100 or top 10 prayers or something like that. And he gets in. He gets her drink of water and he's still crying and his mother tells him to look at the bright side
