Okay, so this story he speaks about first there being three Asian kids in his class. Do I remember the names? Bolo. I think the other two were named Bruce Lee, or like one was Bruce Lee. And the other one was? No, the other one was John. Yeah, he points out that that was weird. Based on the first two kid's names. Then he starts talking about Bolo, specifically, and how his parents were used to like, made like pirated CDs, which is obviously not legal. And how he had a white friend who helped him do this. He was like, computer geek or something, and was really good. At the, I don't know, burning CDs or something that technology went over my head. Eventually, Bolo's parents went to jail, or they got caught or something. And Andrew took over the whole business, which is oh, wait, no, no. The narrator got involved as like a middleman. Because what they had found was that with the black kids that they were selling to, we just take it listen to it and give it back. or something similar. Like they were like, they were getting scammed, basically, by the black kids who didn't want to pay as much as the other kids. And the way their whole business model worked was like, the CDs were sold for like, I forget what the how much it was, but they would sell for like half that. I think it was like I don't know, like $3 which is like $1.50 or something. I forget what the unit of what their dollar is. Yeah, okay. So then they have this whole like business saying they put the the narrator is black, the narrator ends up becoming part of this business as like a middleman. Basically, to sell to the black kids. That works. Then bolos parents get caught, go to jail. I think for some reason, he's out of the business. And now it's just the white kid Andrew, and Trevor Noah. So then they're selling CDs. Trevor Noah is apparently like, really good. At this. He's making money. He talks about being like, Oh, wait, no. They're doing it together. And then Andrew is graduating, he wants to go to college or something. And so he does that. And then the business is left to the narrator. As the narrator continues to sell, he gets gifted the like CD scratcher thing from Andrew. So that he can start his business. And then they Yeah, so then he is doing his thing, selling the CDs and making lots of money. He talks about how he was like ballin so much that he got he was able to buy like a cordless phone before like cell phones were a thing like other kids, especially black kids, were not doing that are not able to do that. That where does the story go. And then he he talks about how basically like the point of the story is that some people might say that he got a handout from the white family, but because the white family Andrew's family has like these like resources that come to them because of their status in society due to their race, which is not given to black students or black people where he's from. And then, based on that people might say that will Trevor Noah was given like a handout, which is not the case. He likens it to like the metaphor of like Teach a man or give a man a fish he eats for a day Teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime. And he points out the flaw in that metaphor is that you need the fishing rod. And that's not like given to you, basically. And so, regardless of it not regardless of where it came from, he still had to like put in the work, basically and hustle to like, be up in his like CD burning business he talks about. What doe he mention? something about not judging like people's music tastes or whatever. Oh, he eventually learned how to like not DJ but people ask him to like, like blur this one song into the next then like basically coming with like requests. I can't remember all the specific ones. And then yeah, basically the point being that he wasn't given a handout and that it's easy to think that but because of where he began, he never would have been like it never counted like that handout will never be equal to the resources that are available to the white people where he's from. Yeah, that's what.
