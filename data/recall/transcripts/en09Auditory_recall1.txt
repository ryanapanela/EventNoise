He began the passage with the something about Bruce Lee. And then he said, John is John. John is just John. He then started talking about a guy named Andrew. And I think the narrator is poor. Because he said someone said that black people don't have any money. And he started saying that he was good at physics. And he started to sell CDs and he needed like $2,000. And he had this kind of business with Andrew about, like, selling CDs and music to people. And I think they were making $250 a week and he started saying, people like, he had all types of music, including hip hop and EDM and South African, but people don't really listen to South African music, where it's at right now is American, African American rap. He also said that someone came up with a good idea or requested that he helped him or someone requested for him to merge tracks together so that when track one ends, track two will start playing with the same beat. And he and Andrew agreed that that was a really good idea. And so he downloaded a computer program and started to merge them together. He was also saying that he was getting good with computers and that he was that guy who could order make McDonald's or who could be on the telephone. Or he can be home on his telephone and he can just go to McDonald's get McDonald's and go back. He also started talking about some analogy with fish. Like if you give a man a fish for a day he'll be happy but yeah, I'm not too sure. It was some fish analogy. I think he also said something like he was when he was merging the tracks together, he was producing on like the vinyl discs.
