Okay. So the narrator has mom and his little brother were going out, and they got into their car, and the car did not start. And then they decided to take the bus. But the bus was unreliable at the time. And this is in South Africa during the apartheid. So they had a separate route of illegal mini buses run for black people specifically, because white people would not want them, I guess they would want them to be at work, but the buses would be unreliable or they would not show up. Or they wouldn't be allowed on. And so they decided to take a mini bus instead. But the since the mini buses were so unreliable, they weren't going to be able to make it on time. And then their mom decided that they should just hitchhike instead, the a car pick them up along the mini bus route, one of the main, the key points is that you don't, since the mini buses were illegal, and it was like a source of income for people. They would, like stealing some customers off of the mini bus route would get you killed. So why they decided to hitchhike on the mini bus route, someone picked them up. And when they were found along the route by somebody driving a bus, the bus driver, and I think two other people came out with a club. It's like a weapon that was used for bashing people's heads in and they pulled him out of the car and started beating him for trying to steal their customers. But the mother of the narrator just said that we were looking for you guys, but you didn't show up. So we got in the car. Our original plan was get on the bus anyway. So we'll just go with you instead. The bus drivers are kind of known for harassing people and like berating them while on the route. So then the bus driver, once they got onto the bus, the bus driver, they were the only three people there. The mom, the mom, the narrator and his little brother, and then the driver, I believe were the only people there. And the bus driver started harassing them about being alone in a car with a man who's not her husband. And then I think the mom was kind of arguing back and it came out that she might have spoken a different dialect or a different language or something. And he the bus driver came to realize that she was from a different tribe, I believe, competing like mortal enemies. And that the group, the ethnic group, the tribe, whatever that she was from, was to the other tribe known to have like, women who were, I don't know, like sluts as he referred to it as the just like cheaters and not loyal to their men and like not pure or whatever. So once he realized that she was from a different tribe, and then she was also in a car with a man who wasn't her husband. He decided that she was going to learn her lesson today, which is what he said to her. And he started speeding. And at this point, the fear of the mother was that she would be raped, her kids would be killed and they basically just didn't know what was going to happen. And she tried to reason with him and tell him to calm down and she she kept her voice calm, and the narrator was falling asleep at this point. So he had no idea what was going on. And because his mother wasn't showing any signs of panic, he wasn't showing any signs of panic either. So then, the mom decided to tell her sons that like when the bus slows down which the bus was slowing down just to check for traffic and intersections, and then it kept speeding forward. That the next time the bus slows down, they're going to jump out of the bus and make a run for it. The narrator didn't hear it because at this point, he was asleep and then the bus slowed down. The mom grabbed him and like threw him out of the bus and they started rolling down a hill. And as soon, at this point, the narrator had woken up because he hit the ground. And he was shocked but his mom told him to run and he started running. And they mentioned that they were the, they were there fast runners there. Were the champions of some college running thing. And they just all made a run for it after rolling down that hill for some time and the adrenaline kicked in. So they didn't really notice that they were in pain. And then as the, as they kept running the bus driver, and I think his two men tried to follow them, but they couldn't keep up. And eventually they got to a gas station. And they called the police. But by that time, the men who were chasing them were long gone. At this point, they noticed that they had cuts and blood all over them, except for the baby brother who was miraculously completely fine. And he asked his mom why she did that. And she said, What do you mean, they were going to kill us? And then he was like, You didn't tell me that they were gonna kill us. And then she's like, Yeah, I did tell you that they were gonna kill us. And he's like, Well, I was asleep. And she was like, so did you want me to leave you there to get killed and I go run off. And then he started. He's like nine at this point, I think so he was just like yelling at his mom and being like we should have taken as a sign from God when the car didn' start this morning. And it was like it was the devil whispering to us to keep moving and then they just argued about God's will for a little bit. And then he said, next time, could you ask jesus to just meet us at our house or something like that? And then they laughed about it and the story ends
