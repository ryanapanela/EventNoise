In Hollywood, whenever they show someone jumping or rolling out of a moving car, they just get up and dust themselves off. I know that's not how it is in real life at all and every time I see that I shake my head when I was nine years old I first had this experience of jumping out of a moving car. It was Sunday and we were getting ready to go to church, me and my mom and my baby brother. She woke me up early and I was half asleep, but I had my breakfast with orange juice, while she gave my brother Andrew a bath. When we got to the car, it wouldn't start. My mom insisted that we go to church at this time, during apartheid, there was no publicly funded transportation system. However, because White South Africans still needed their black maids and housekeepers to be able to get into the city from the townships. They allot, private networks of many buses were allowed. But most of these private networks were run, like gang or mafia style. And a driver taking another driver's route would result in fights or possibly death. When my mom saw that the car could no longer start, she still insisted that we wait for one of these mini buses. After a while when none came along, she suggested let's hitchhike. Eventually, a driver stopped. And we got in. But after some time, and mini bus, cut him off. And several or two Zulu men came out with clubs that they use for beating people up, stopped the driver and threatened him saying asking him, why would you steal our customers? My mother intervened and said he's just trying to help us out. We'll come ride with you. That's what we wanted to do in the first place is catch mini bus. So me, still half asleep, my mother, my baby brother, we leave the car we get into the mini bus. Now the mini bus has other than being a place of violence. We're also known for having drivers who complained and harangue the customers and this one was no different. The driver and the other man or men, mostly the driver was Zulu. And followed the firmly held stereotype. And that Zulu woman were dutiful and proper. Whereas Xhosa women, like my mother, were considered promiscuous and improper. And here she was alone with two children, one of them, obviously, a mixed race child. My mother kept telling him to mind his own business. But then he made a comment that just like a dirty hustler woman to be stepping into a car with a strange man that you will learn your lesson tonight and he started speeding up. My mother then leaned over and whispered to me though I was half asleep, that when he slows down an intersection, I need to open the door and jump out. My mother was scared that she would be raped and we would be killed. The driver kept driving really fast and would only slow down intersections to check for traffic. Eventually, when he slowed down at an intersection my mother opened the door and pushed me out. She then grabbed my baby brother wrapped herself up around him, curled yourself up around him and rolled out as well. I hit the pavement, like boom. And I noted that my mother was beside me but was already on her feet with my brother. She then screamed for us to run. So we ran. At that point in the townships, death was everywhere. To maybe if I was a nine year old deadlift, somewhere else I would have been faced, but I wasn't I was running on so much adrenaline. And I knew that if my mom said, Run, we ran. And we kept running. The driver and the other man or men get out of their car and try to chase us. But they couldn't. We were running. You were flying fast. And they couldn't believe that they had been out run by this woman and her two children. We only stopped running when we got to a 24 hour petrol station. That's when I asked my mom, why were we running? I told her how, why? I told her that I'm in pain. I looked down and noticed that the skin of my arms had been scraped off from the fall and so had my mother's but my baby brother was completely unharmed. Mom said they were going to try and kill us. I asked her why she tried to push me out. She said, Well, I told you to jump and you didn't. So I had to push you. I said I was half asleep. She said, What was I supposed to leave you they're asleep and wait for them to kill you. I said, well, at least they would have woken me up before killing me. And then we both laughed, like we did. She started talking about thanking God. I told her that maybe we should have listened to God, when the car broke down, that we shouldn't have gone to church and this was the devil tricking us. My mother said no, this is not how the devil works. If God didn't want us here, he wouldn't have put us here. I asked her if maybe next time. Jesus could come to us rather than have us go all the way to church on a Sunday because it's just not working out. And we both laughed again.
