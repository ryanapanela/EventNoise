Which leads into his story. The day when he, his he and his brother, I believe that his name was Andrew and his mother left their village one day, too because their car wouldn't start they needed, they needed to use the buses. He started talking about how the buses because of apartheid. The black community didn't, wasn't able to get good transit systems. So they were run by a whoever could control them at the time. And how the routes were very well guarded by the people who ran them. And it was very important that drivers didn't try and steal other routes because that's how they ended they could end up dead. And then he moved on to saying that they were also unpredictable and they didn't know when the buses would come or at what how long it would be in between each bus. Since there is no regulation. Then he moves on to his stories. They were waiting on the side of the road for one such bus and none was coming. So after a long time, they started to walk until someone, a car pulled over beside them and offered them a ride. They all got in and just as they were about to drive off. Zulu bus swerved or came up came up from the side of them and cut them off. And the driver and his crony would came out with these traditional Zulu weapons somewhere to large bats and hit the or took the driver of the car out and hit him with the bats until the mothers said don't do that. He was just trying to help we'll go with you instead. So they got into the bus started driving with them. And he described how the the narrator described how the bus drivers tend to be very rowdy and and angry and just this one was a very angry one in particular who started going off about how you that the woman shouldn't have been in a car with someone who wasn't her husband.

He started yelling because apparently the Zulus and Xhosans have a big rivalry rivalry
he started saying that all all of them were all the Xhosan women were sluts, things like that. Then he went off to say that he'd show he'd show up he the fix that tonight and started driving manically without stopping, just slowing down at the intersections to make sure he doesn't get hit by another car.

So she whispered to the narrator who was sleeping at that time that he should he that they were going to jump at the next intersection, even though he was asleep. So they grabbed her once the intersection came up, she opened the door, grabbed the narrator threw him out and then jumped out after curl, curled up in front of the younger one and jumped out shielding the younger one from the fall. And then they started running. The Zulu driver got out and started chasing them, but they were the fastest runners of Maryland. High school or country or county or something like that. They described how they were running so quickly, for a very long time until the people gave up. And then they started walking towards a petrol station and was describing the bruises and cuts that he got another 24 hour petrol station they called the police and as they were waiting there, they discussed about why they were there and what happened and the reasonings behind it developed into a discussion about the will of God and how the mother believed that the God was brought them there for a reason.
