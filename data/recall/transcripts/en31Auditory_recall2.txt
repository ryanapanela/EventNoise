So when Trevor was in the ninth grade, three Chinese students came to his school. Bolo, Bruce Lee, and John. Bolo was called Bolo, because he had a bowl cut. Bruce Lee, that was his actual name. And that was the best thing that could ever happen to them. Or to the school. You had this young, good looking Chinese guy, and his name was actually Bruce Lee. John was just John, which was confusing given the other two names. Turns out Bolo's parents were in the piracy business. And they sold like counterfeit CDs and DVDs, and Bolo being their son did the same thing. So he would sell bootleg video games at school students would give them their Playstations or Xboxes. And he would return them with a chip that allowed them to play these bootleg games. There was another student at the school named Andrew, who also bootleged CDs. And Bolo and Andrew working together. One day Trevor overheard them saying that they don't like the black students, because black students would say I'll pay you later and never pay them back. And they were too scared of the black students to go ask for the money. So Trevor, joining the conversation was like, let me be the middleman I can help you. So he joined them and he sold to the black students. He also ran the tuck shop. So he already had  a network of people to kind of help sell. So that was good. One day, Bolo left. And the rumor was that his parents had got arrested. And Andrew was set to graduate. So it was just Trevor doing all this bootleg business with all the money he was making. And Trevor, like, bought his own computer stuff and started doing some more work on his own, and making these bootleg stuff. Andrew taught him how to use computers because Andrew was older and wasn't a computer nerd. So he didn't know what was going on. The one thing that Trevor couldn't get was a CD something that was the final piece to do everything on his own, but it was super expensive, pretty much the same cost as his whole computer. So when Andrew graduated, he gave that to Trevor. And that allowed Trevor to become like the main kind of bootleg dealer at the school. So Trevor kept doing all that kept building his own little empire. At home he had so the CD machine thing was like, it allowed him to copy a CD at the same pace as the CD played. So every day after school, he would go home, and just sit there for like, a few hours burning these CDs. He also got these speakers from the junkyard and put them all around his room. At the time, when he first started, he had dial up internet. So it would take like the whole day just to get one album. But as technology got better, he was able to buy more of these CD burner thingies and do multiple albums at the same time. He himself didn't know too much about music, he only knew like Christian Jesus music. So this kind of showed him other music. He never judged people for their tastes. There was like Nirvana DMX. He did all those. What was really popular was American hip hop rap albums, those sold really well. So by that point, he was able to get two more people to work under him two of his friends. And then one of them would suggest like, hey, instead of just doing one album per CD, why don't you take the best songs of every album and make your own CD? So people would just listen to the songs that they like. So Trevor's like, Oh, that's a great idea, he started doing that so those were selling really, really well. And then the friend was like, could you make it so that the tracks fade into each other? Instead of there being like a hard stop after every song. Trevor was like, oh my god that's a great idea. So started doing that and essentially created this like party mix CDs are also sold insanely insanely well. And then he says this was all thanks to Andrew giving him his first CD burning tool thing. So Andrew was White came from a place of resource and access to all this information, whereas Trevor didn't, his family didn't have access to these things. And Trevor kind of goes into this piece, where access to resources is what allowed Andrew to be successful and do all these things where as Trevor even though he couldn't sell all these things, even though he had like the natural talent to sell these, he wouldn't be able to without that first CD thing that he got from Andrew without the resource. He went into like the you know, what's the analogy where people always say, Teach a man to fish. And, or give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day, Teach a man to fish, he'll eat for the rest of his life. The analogy should include, you should also give the man a fishing rod because that's the most important part. A lot of people will think that that's a handout. But Trevor argues that no, the person still has to put in the work. So he put in all that work. He had all that talent that would have gone to waste. They've not been for the access to resources that Andrew allowed. So that person of privilege kind of needs to be there to help get access to said resources for him to be successful.
