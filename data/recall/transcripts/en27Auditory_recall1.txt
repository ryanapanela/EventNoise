So this guy is talking about how when he went to school first he started talking about how there were only like, there were these three Chinese kids who he was going to school with. And he talked about how one was named bolo, I believe, and the other one was named Bruce Lee. And I forget the third one's name, but he basically started going into business with them. He had because one of them I think bolo, his family pirated other music or videos or something, they had some sort of pirating business and so they started doing that at school with video games, I believe. And then, he was gifted by I think, one of his friends, Andrew, a CD writer or CD copier, and then eventually it progressed into copying music and then they started making like, mixtapes. And yeah, just getting more creative with it. They started a business. That was after he was the middleman, middleman between. I don't remember.Something at school where he would be filming music and basically copied video games. And he was talking about how Andrew had lots of like opportunity and he grew up (Andrw didn't), the storyteller I forget the storytellers name, but he grew up like poor so he didn't, he didn't really have the resources to I guess, have a business and make something of themselves. So it kind of all started when Andrew gave him the CD writer, I think it's called and things just kind of went from there.
