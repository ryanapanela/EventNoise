Okay, so in this story, three Chinese kids move to the school that Trevor is at. One of them is named bolo, I think, based on his John Claude Van Damme movie, the other one is called Bruce Lee. And that's his actual name. And the third one is called John and bolos. Family, Trevor says are pirates because they pirate movies and games, video games, things like that, and then they sell them. So because his parents are doing this bolo also ends up starting to do the same thing. And him and his friend Andrew that he does this with, end up selling a whole bunch of games, but they ran into a bit of trouble, because the black kids that they're selling the games to are taking the games and saying that they'll pay them later, but they don't end up paying at all. But Bolo and Andrew are too scared to actually go ask for the money. So Trevor decides that he's going to ask them if they can all partner together. And that he would be the middleman and he would take the games over to the black kids and make sure that he gets the money from them. Back to bolo, and Andrew and then the, the kids would then give him a cut of the profit. So they start doing this business and they're making money and then at one point, Bolo actually is no longer part of this. He thinks that Trevor says that his parents may have gotten arrested. So Trevor ends up just doing running the business with Andrew. And one of the things that Trevor is missing at his house is a CD writer, because they're super expensive. So he has a computer. But he doesn't have a CD writer, since just the CD writer itself, costs almost as much as his whole computer setup. So at one point, Andrew also ends up, no longer wanting to be part of their little business. So he ends up gifting the CD writer to Trevor, who then is now equipped to just be able to run this business all by himself. So he starts to just keep doing this and pirating all by himself, and then someone ends up asking him if, instead of just pirating and copying the whole entire album of music, for example, and at that time, Andrew only knew about church music. But what was actually popular with the kids was r&b and hip hop music and jagged edge and 112 were very popular at the time. But people didn't necessarily like all of the songs on an album. They only liked some of them. So Trevor's asked if he can just pick and choose all of the best songs that people like and put those on a CD, and copied only those songs. So he starts doing that and that becomes really popular. And then from there, he starts to actually mix the songs he gets a program called beats per minute, and I think the logo is two vinyls side by side. And he starts to be able to use that software to fade the music into each other and go from one song straight into the other and doing cool things like that for people and almost basically creates, like DJ sets on the CDs, and his business is basically booming.
