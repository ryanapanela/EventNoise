Trevor starts the story describing how in Hollywood movies, the special effects are so drastic, or so exaggerated that very specific example he's describing how being thrown out of the car is much more painful. And then he describes how he knows because he has been thrown out of a car. As he starts the story describing how him and his mother and his brother lived in apartheid South Africa. And they were on their way to assuming to work, his mom had to go to work that morning. But the car wouldn't start. So instead of just waiting around or walking, or like hitchhiking, they decided to wait for the bus. And he describing how in apartheid South Africa. The black people that lived there still had to serve, or work for all of the white people. He's describing how, because there was no transit system put in place before. A lot of black workers just banded together to make their own with Metro Transit System. But because you don't have like, a single regulated system for a specific region. All of these private Metro companies started competing for space and for routes, he's describing that it was so territorial, that if you didn't stay to your route or if you decided to drive people around outside of your designated routes, it was grounds for killing. He described it as sort of like a bunch of organized crime syndicates, and him and his mom and his nine month old brother are still standing at the bus stop. And they're there for a long time, for a few hours, and he gets really tired and his legs are falling asleep. But his mom says, oh, let's go hitchhike. Let's just walk. There's no point in waiting for the bus if it's going to take this long. And as they're walking, a car pulls up beside them, and it's a man driving and he tells him to get in. They get in the car, they're driving for a little bit. A mini bus swerves past them, and there's two people in them both with some sort of machete or cleaver. And there's two people holding them. And they get the driver of the car, that Trevor and his mother and his brother arein, and they start yelling at him and pointing weapons in his face. Screaming why would you pick these two up? Do you understand what you're doing? What are you doing taking our routes, stay in your own lane. And his mom interjects, pleading with them. Like he was just trying to help us like we'll drive with you like the only reason that we're in his car is because we were waiting for you to pick us up at the bus stop anyway, so they agree, they accept. So Trevor and his brother and his mother all get on the bus. And the bus driver is lecturing them like yelling things at them and his mom fires back a little bit defending herself and her two sons and the bus driver. While he's throwing things at his mother he realizes that Trevor's mother's is a Xhosa woman and Trevor is talking about how Zulu and Xhosa women in South Africa are very discriminated against being the basis of like, Zulu women being dutiful and proper and patient and Xhosa women being whorish or disorganized. And the bus driver, he says oh you're a Xhosa woman. And it gets worse and berating gets worse and he starts talking, he starts yelling at this woman wagging his finger in the mirror. Just screaming like really horrible, obscene things at her. And she tries to reason with him saying like please, sir just let us off the bus like, it's okay we'll just walk from here. We're sorry for bothering you. And the driver says, you made a lot of big mistakes tonight. And tonight, you're going to learn your lesson. So he speeds up the car and the driving faster down the street, the barreling down the street. And this is actually specifically when his mother Trevor's mother starts to, again like plead for her and her children saying please just let us go, Look, we'll walk from here, it's fine. He refuses to comply, just keeps on driving. And Trevor didn't perceive anything as wrong because he didn't really process that. His mom was really stressed. But he was, if not asleep than half asleep at this moment, but his mom shakes him a little. And she says, Trevor, when he slows down a little bit, I'm going to pull this window or the slide door, because that's where they were sitting there was sitting beside the door, I'm going to pull this side door and we're going to jump and he doesn't really process that fully because he's still half asleep. And when the bus driver, he comes a little bit of a stop. To check both of the sides of the road. His mother pushes the door open and throws Trevor out the window and grabs Andrew in her arms. And she throws herself out the window. And Trevor is still being greatly confused and greatly hurt and scraped, but it doesn't really process all the injuries at the moment because he's still very much half asleep. But his mom screams like run. They start running they start running, out running these two bus drivers. They have actually outrun them. Trevor describes how him and his mom or I suppose like notoriously fast runners. They went how like, their college they're like the fastest in their syndicate or like the area. But very fast runners. Completely outran these two bus drivers, he remembers the face of them giving up and being greatly confused that this mother with two small children is still able to run so quickly. They make it to the the petrol gas station and they call the police. And while he's relieved, or at least both of them are related. They outran those two bus drivers, Trevor is now processing all the scrapes all the skin that he's lost all the like the flesh and is literally exposed. And everything starts to sink in a little bit and he start not to yell will have to raise voice presumably at mother saying, like, why would you throw me under the bus because he still doesn't understand what happened. And she says like, What do you mean, why did they throw you out of the bus? They said that they were going to kill us? And he says well at least. If they were going to kill us, they would have woken me up first. And it's a back and forth, back and forth. And he says like Mom, I know you love Jesus. They start with talking about how it was God's plan for us stand up here. Maybe it was probably just God's plan to not go outside and stay home because the car wouldn't start. Because the devil like we saw the devil tonight. And his mom said like no that's not how the devil works and then it was like a back and forth back and forth about religion. Then Trevor says, Well, Mom, I know you love Jesus so much, but I
