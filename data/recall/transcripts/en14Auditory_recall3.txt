When I was in grade nine, three Chinese kids transferred to my high school, Sandringham. They were the only Chinese pupils in the whole school. Their names were Bo Yeung, Bruce Lee. And Johnny. Bo Yeung was nicknamed that way because he reminded people of the character Bo Yeung from Jean-Claude Van Damme's recent movie. Movie name. Bruce Lee was his actual name, which totally made our life. Imagine this quiet, good looking, really athletically fit kid, whose actual name was Bruce Lee, and we were all laughing joke. Thank you, Jesus for bringing us Bruce Lee, Johnny was just called Johnny. So Bo Yeung's parents were pirates. They would make and sell bootleg copies of movies. And at that point, I was running my tech shop. Bo Yeung, we're also work with a student named Andrew, who was two years older than us. And you had a CD writer at a time when pretty much nobody had them. And he would sometimes make like burn or make CDs as well. One day, I overheard Andrew and Bo Yeung complaining about black students at the school that they would take the merchandise and say they would pay them back but never did. And because Bo yeung and Andrew were scared of black people. They wouldn't go after them for the money. I leaned in and explained to them that black people, mostly at the school don't have any money. So trying to get things for free is something they do. But that because of my connections at the Tech Shop, they should make me a middleman. I can go after you know the customers that haven't paid and also get a profit. So you Andrew and Bo yeung agreed. I started doing that and things are going well. Eventually, Andrew also showed me how to burn CDs. I started making CDs and eventually Andrew matriculated because he was older. At that point, though, I couldn't afford my own CD writer. They were about 2000 Rand which at the time was the same cost as my entire computer. But when he matriculated, he said he would be out of the game. He would. So he gave me he bequeath the CD ROM writer to me, and that was the greatest thing he had ever done that changed my life. Also, eventually, Bo Yeung disappeared from school and the rumor was that his parents had gotten caught and arrested. For pirating. Andrew showed me how to burn CDs. I had a friend who lived in a township called Alex. He was one of the two middle men working for me. He suggested that we fade the tracks into each other so it sounds like DJ. He also suggested that we make like Greatest Hits and party mixes. He asked why don't we just put the best songs from different cities on one album because people just want to listen to their favorite songs anyways. I didn't know much about music at the time, because I only ever listened to Christian gospel songs which was the only things allowed in my mother's house. And the CD writer that Andrew had given to me was 1x, which meant that it recorded CDs in real time. So that means after school I would go home and sit for five or six hours listening to these different CDs at first I wouldn't really I would hear but not really listen to the music. I wouldn't judge people for their taste of music. If they wanted Nirvana, they could have that if one could DMX. They could have that as well. Local South African music was popular, but what was insanely popular was American hip hop. Jagged Edge was huge. 112 was huge. The money was flowing in, I was balling out of control. I eventually had gotten myself a wireless phone, this was at the time where nobody had cell phones, the range of the phone was so powerful that I could leave the base outside of my window, walk to the McDonald's holding the phone around the block, order my large number one, I'd walk all the way back and still carry on the conversation with my friend like yeah, I'm just going to McDonald's. I was that kid walking around with a giant phone with the aerial antenna sticking all the way out. The speakers in my room, we're basically from old junk cars that Abel had in the front that I'd fashioned together. That experience with Andrew, that changed my life helped me understand that you do like those that are marginalized or disenfranchised do you need someone with more opportunities. To help them Andrew's family was White had access to computers and education. There, his family for generations would be raised preparing to go to university. While mine would be cramped together and huts, singing silly songs like two plus two is four. lalalalalala is part of our education. People talk a lot about instead of giving a man a fish to teach them how to fish but what they often leave out is you need to give a man a fishing rod. So sometimes you need someone from a more primitive class to say, this is what you need to be done. And this is how you can do it. I had a lot of talent, but it would have been completely useless without different opportunities that were given to me by someone more privileged. People often lecture the poor about taking responsibility for themselves. But this is how I learned the importance of this sometimes someone with more privilege helping someone who's more disenfranchised in life and people say that's a handout. It wasn't a handout. He gave me the tools I still had to work hard to achieve it myself.
