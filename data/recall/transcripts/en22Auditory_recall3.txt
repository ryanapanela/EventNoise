Okay, so the story begins with the storyteller, saying, when he get, he got a hair cut. He started, I didn't understand if you got like a berm or her cut, he started getting more attention from girls. Because the girls would think it was interesting that he was like taking this time to take care of his hair on off himself. And then his mother was teasing him saying that he she would never date someone that takes more time to take more time, like doing his hair than she takes her time doing her hair. And the storyteller keeps saying that her, his mom was more relaxed. Most of the time, she would be in the garden, doing like gardening and stuff, wearing overalls, and she didn't really care about her like appearance. But when Sunday would come up there, they would always go to church. And she would always, like, get ready to her hair. And he said that she would look like really good. She and he and they would go to church. And he wondered like how many like hearts, she broke during her life. And he only remember like his father. And like they never married but they had like a relationship. And also his stepdad, which is Andrews, his baby brother's father. So he says that I think they met when, like, kiss, their car would always break down. And they took like this to this place to get it fixed. And there was like this guy with long arms, I don't know, something like that strong arms. And his mom, I think that he was interested in they started kind of dating. And one time.

And then he goes to talk, he goes to talk to like to Andrew, his brother, and tells him like his mother has been shot. And they go to the hospital try to find out what is going on. And I didn't understand it was Angela said that, but like, and I also didn't understand it if it was the stepdad who shot her or the other guy. But this guy shot her on the neck and also in the head.
