This story follows a black or black South African African man named Trevor, as he recalls his his younger years and how he got into the pirating business, he begins the story mentioning that three Chinese students transferred to his school and they were the only ones Chinese students out of 1000 people. And he mentioned so one of them was name Bao Lau. And another one was named Bruce Lee. Bao Lau, his parents were piraters and sold bootleg movies and other things bootleg pirated. And so he started selling pirated movies and things to the students. And it he eventually paired up with a white South African named Andrew, and helped his business because he had a copywriter. So Bao Lau and Andrew, however, had a problem since they didn't like selling to black students, because they would often not pay them who would say oh, I'll pay you later, and then not pay them at all. And so they basically steal. And they were scared to sell to them. So, Trevor, hearing their problems, offered to be a middleman since he was black, I guess, so that he can help with their business, and he ended up helping and being a middleman and doing well. Eventually, Bao Lau left the school, it's and he said that it's assumed that his parents got arrested. And Andrew, who was two years older than them, eventually graduated, I believe, and gave his copywriter to Trevor. And Trevor was really delighted. This is the one thing that he needed to start his own business since he knew from being his experience being a middleman that he was good at selling, and that he enjoyed it, but he didn't have the technology to produce his own CDs so now with the copywriter, he was able to start his business and he was mostly pirating music and selling the CDs. And he was getting really successful at it. And he eventually, he was so successful that he had his own people helping him two people. And one of them suggested different things that he could do to sell such as like compiling a bunch of songs onto one CD, lot of favorite songs onto one CD to sell people instead of just selling people out individual albums. And also mixing the songs on the CDs like an, like a DJ set. And this was popular, people liked it and he thought that it was a really good idea. And it showed him the importance of getting suggestions. He also mentioned that a lot of a lot of majority of his sales he will he gave people whatever they asked for but a majority of his sales were people asking for pirated American black music. And though he also sold local South African music as well eventually was so successful with this pirating that he was able to get multiple copywriters and even a cordless phone which was really expensive and not something many people had at the time, yet. Trevor ends his story reflecting on the impact Andrew had on his life and his career, just with his simple act of giving the copywriter to him. He states that he had the talent and the know how, and the passion for selling. But he would have never been able to start his business without the copywriter that he was given, there was no way that he could have gotten himself as it was something that a lot of black South Africans at the time just didn't have the money for. He makes a comparison about black South Africans and white South Africans at the time and how different their upbringings are and how that leads to different outcomes and success, and how important it is or how impactful it is when somebody who does come from a more privileged place helps out somebody who's disadvantaged, like in his case, and he mentions the metaphor, or the allegory about how people say, if you give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day. But if you give a man Oh, if you teach a man how to fish he'll eat for the rest of his life. And he mentioned that a lot of people forget. Or don't consider that. How important it is that the in this allegory that somebody gives the man a fishing pole as well. And he relates it to his story. Basically, Andrew gave him the fishing pole, which was the copywriter and how important it is that that happened. And that that sometimes is the only way for to lift certain people out of poverty is giving a hand to them. Because if they don't have, you know, knowledge is fine, but if they don't have the resources to do anything with that knowledge, they can't succeed. So yeah
