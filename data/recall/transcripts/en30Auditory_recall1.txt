Okay, so the narrator His name is Trevor. When he was younger, he went to the salon and got his hair done. And he really liked it. It was the first time he started getting noticed by girls and going on dates. He wasn't sure exactly why he thought maybe the girls thought he looked cute, or it was because he was suffering to make himself look good, like they did. So he started going to the salon all the time, he would do his hair for hours, just to make it look good. And his mom would laugh at him, saying that he spent way too much time at the salon. Yeah, Trevor's mom is a very confident person. She's very beautiful. And she only needs to shower in order to be just as pretty if not prettier than Trevor is. And she told him so laughing, said that she didn't really try during the week. But as soon as the weekend came, and it was time to go to church, she got all dolled up. And she was the prettiest one in the family. Trevor's mom only had two men in her life. It was Trevor's dad. And Abel, who she met at the mechanic repair car mechanic. Their car would break down very frequently. So they took it to a repair shop nearby. And Abel was this tall, long, lanky arms, skinny, but still muscular guy who could lift an end car engine above his head. And she fell for him. And their car broke down frequently. So they would go all the time and see him and then eventually it seemed like they were going without the car being broken down. So they got married. It was no ceremony. They just did the paperwork and got married. And then they had a baby together. Trevor's little brother Andrew. But Trevor's life didn't really change. He was, you know, not responsible for changing the diapers or anything. So he would just go out and play. And yeah, it wasn't until a couple of years later, he was starting to make a name for himself as a comedian. And one morning he was asleep and he gets a call from who he thinks is his mom. And turns out to be Andrew, his little brother on the phone acting very calm. He asks him if he is awake. If he's doing anything, and Trevor says no. Trevor says I'm I'm sleeping but not like nothing's up. So then Andrew says that their mom has been shot. And Trevor is very confused about this. He was like, why? In his head, he's thinking, why is Andrew so calm about this so stoic? And also why is he asking me if I'm busy right now the first thing out of his mouth should be our mom has been shot. So Trevor was like, oh my god, I'm on my way. Like he jumps out of bed. He goes to his friend's place banging on the door being like my mom's been shot. So then they go to the hospital to meet Andrew. And he calls Andrew back, asking where his mother got shot. And Andrew is very calm still. And he says in the leg and show well, I don't remember if it's before after but Trevor knows inherently that it's Abel that Abel is the one who shot his mom. But then Andrew says that she was also shot in the head. In the face, I think now is when Trevor puts it together that it's Abel who shot his mom. And Trevor remembers the exact stoplight that he heard this because he completely froze. And he's thinking back to how he thought when he was younger, he should just kill Abel. But he could never kill anyone. He understands that and he's just frozen at the stoplight and he can barely see the road and then light turns green, or no he's crying. He could barely see the road. This is some like tears. He's never, he's never cried this hard in his life, it will make all other crying. Look like not real pain, basically. And then he drives to the hospital. He meets Andrew out front. And it's not until he sees Trevor that Andrew finally breaks down just crying and sobbing, and it's not the same pain that Trevor felt his is more due to helplessness. And then they go up into the hospital and his mother is bandaged she has a bandage around her head and her face on her eye on her nose. And she's asleep and the doctor says that she's stable. There's nothing that they could do. So they should just go home and sleep. So they go home. And then the next morning, Trevor comes back, and he's sitting with his mom who's still sleeping. Eventually, she opens up her one eye, and he starts crying. And she tells him to look on the bright side. Or he says that this woman loves Jesus. She's in the top 100. Prayers, top 100 People who pray for Jesus and this is the thing she gets. And then eventually she opens up her one good eye and Trevor's crying and she tells him to look on the bright side. And Trevor cannot understand what the bright side is in the situation and his mom goes, you're finally the pretty one now. And then she smiles and he starts laughing hysterically. And that's where it ends. Go
