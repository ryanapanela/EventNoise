He starts off by talking about three Chinese boys. One of them, his parents were like, they pirated a lot of things, movies. And that was their job. Because of that, he started to pirate video games at school. And then he worked with Andrew, who's a white guy. And they had like, all the systems that computer systems to do the technology to pirate it. And then they were complaining that black people wouldn't pay but then this other guy, the black guy. He's like, Oh, they just don't have money. They're complaining about people wouldn't pay but they were like afraid to go up to the black people to make them pay. So then he was like, this third guy, he was like if they let him into the business, then he'll be able to make like the black people pay. He'll get the customers and do like the networking. And if he got like a cut of the profits. They started working together. And then the Asian guy left. So just the white guy and the black guy. And then eventually the white guy stopped doing it and then he gave. The white guy was teaching him everything on how to do the whole business all the things that you need, like the CDs, and like the technology. And the black guy was saying that he had the talent, the ambition but he just didn't have the technology. He needed this one thing that pirated, that would pirate the stuff like computer. But it was a lot of money. He couldn't afford it. The white guy stopped he gave, he gave his computer thing to him. From then he was able to run his whole business by himself. He did everything. He was making a lot of money. He said he was balling. He was going to McDonald's, he got like a phone before people like it was a big deal back then to have a phone. Then he was talking about like privilege, how he was able to become successful because he got resources from privileged people. That's what you need in order to be able to because he had the motivation, he had the skill, the talent, but he lacked the resources. And once he had that, in general, like people, black people who lack the resources aren't able to do it. Are they able to do it without it? He made like an analogy.
