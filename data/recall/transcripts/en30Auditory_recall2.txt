All right, so our narrator is Trevor again, he's back. And he's talking about a time in school where three Chinese kids were the new students and think they made fun of one of them and called them Bruce Lee. But it was funny because his name actually turned out to be Bruce Lee. One of them was named Andrew. And I don't remember the others name. But Andrews parents sold pirated, like DVDs and games. And so Andrew started to sell them at school. Basically, he would take people's Playstations home and then return them with a chip that made it so that they could play pirated games, and then he would sell them the games. And what started to happen was there was a group I think he said they were black. But there was a group that figured out that they could just not pay Andrew for the pirated stuff, and so they just weren't paying him because they didn't respect the Chinese. And so Andrew enlisted Trevor to be the middleman. So Trevor would have the merchandise basically, and give it and then get the money. And Trevor would get a cut of whatever was sold for his part as middleman. And this went on for a while until one of the other guys got, he was taken out of school. Actually, this guy is the one with the pirate with the parents. Okay, Andrews parents were not selling the pirated stuff. It was the other guy, but Andrew was also involved. But the other guy, he got taken out of school, and the Rumors were that his parents went to jail because they were selling the pirated stuff. But anyway, Andrew kind of took over. And I don't remember what happened next. Eventually, Trevor was making a lot of money. And he wanted to get something called a CD writer. And he couldn't afford it. Andrew gave him a CD writer or bought it for him. But this allowed Andrew sorry, this allowed Trevor to make his own pirated CDs, to sell. So he only knew about Christian music, because that's the only music that was allowed in his household. So he had to learn about other music. But the CD writer allowed him to copy albums. So he started doing that and selling them. So whatever. The internet allowed him to get people whatever they wanted, if they wanted the newest Nirvana, they could get the newest nirvana. And then Andrew thought it would be a good idea for Trevor to instead of putting the whole album on a CD, to put only the tracks that people liked from different albums, because people only want to hear the stuff they like. And then Andrew had a better idea to make the tracks bleed into one another. So there wasn't a break between tracks. So like a mixtape. And so Andrew, Trevor downloaded a program and started making these mix CDs and selling them. And it used to take them a day to download a full album. But with the money, he kept investing in his business and upgrading and eventually he was doing it really, really fast. And then at one point, he bought a lamp, no a cordless phone. This was before people had cell phones. And he was able to walk out of his house down the like two blocks to the McDonald's, order his number one and then walk all the way back to his room while talking on the phone. And he was really happy about then again he says that none of this would have happened without Andrew. And that the old saying like Trevor had the talent but he never would have discovered this talent without the help Andrew they say that if you give a man a fish he'll eat for a day. But if you teach amount of fish, he'll eat for a lifetime. But no one ever says that you also need to give the man the fishing pole. Because without access to resources, it doesn't matter. If you have the knowledge or the talent, you cannot do it without the resources. So for Andrew to give Trevor, the CD writer he's eternally grateful because he never would have been able to do that. Without it. Yeah,
