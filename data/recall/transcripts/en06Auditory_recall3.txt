At the beginning of the story, the narrator describes how transport is difficult where he is sort of because sort of the apartheid and segregation. And the irony of like, you know, being expected to be somewhere on time without actually having a proper means. So, in his community, I think sort of a more private transport system or something was created amongst them, but it wasn't really reliable. And I think they're called mini buses, but from what it sounds like, it sounded like a taxi sort of service. And the idea was, you know, sometimes, you know, if they come on time, and they would come on time, and if they didn't, then they didn't. And so one day, their family car broke down. And they're forced to use this option. And it's either on the way to church or on the way home, that him his mother and his baby brother are, you know, using one of these mini buses, and and so the driver, sure is driving erratically or something, and they nearly get to, like an accident. And so the, with another mini bus driver, and the two drivers are sort of fighting and and, and to calm, you know, the one of them down, like the one that they weren't with originally, they're like, she was like, oh, no, we want to go with you. That's, you know, because I think they're, he was upset that they were, you know, using somebody else's service. I don't know and so they switched drivers, and they, you know, start chatting, and, and I think the driver figures out that, you know, their family is of a certain descent, I think, Zulu. And so there are certain ideas around, you know, the sub culture. And I think, in particular, women of them. So I think one idea was that, you know, they're sure of promiscuous and not dutiful. And so this driver has sort of a negative perception of the, of Trevor's mother. And, you know, he's even looking at the kids and noticing that, you know, although his mother's black, presumably, one of the kids is mixed. And so and I think the driver might make might have made a commentary, like, oh, you know, you're getting into cars with like, the strange men like their previous driver, and so on and so forth. And his mother's not taking any of this and she tells him to shut up and like mind his own business. And he doesn't take that well. And sort of, there's this uneasy tension in the car and, you know, the mother tries to, you know, calmly, be like, Oh, we can get out here and such. I don't know how she justifies it, but she keeps insisting that, you know, they can walk from whatever point they're at. The driver keeps driving, and he's like, No, it's okay. It's okay. And so the mother feels very uneasy, and he she leans over to Trevor, and tells him that, you know, if this car slows at the next intersection, or when it does, you know, jump out and start running. But at this point, he's like, half asleep, so he doesn't hear it, process it. So when they do reach the next stop, like she opens his sliding door and pushes them out of the car. And she grabs his baby brother, and, you know, tucks him into her and also does the same, she rolls out of the car. And the two of them, Trevor and his mom holding her baby there, like rolling and rolling and rolling. And also, all at the beginning of the story, he mentions how he seen movies where, you know, stunt people are in an action movies, they sort of roll out of car. Or, like, they exit a car suddenly, and they roll and roll until they stop. But you know, they seem to recover from it fine. And he's thinking how that's not how it is in real life. And so that, that links to the situation. And as soon as they come to the stop, his mother tells him to run. And so they run as fast as we could, until they reach a gas station. And at that point, you know, when they started running, the driver also got out of his car and chase after him too. Until they reached the gas station, which I guess he either quit or had stop long before that. And Trevor has now the time to like, process anything up until that point. Because, you know, he thinks that, you know, he'd lived a different life, he would have reacted a bit more slowly. But, you know, asking when his mom pushed him out of car, you know, asking, you know, why did you do that? Or, you know, why are we running, but instead, he understands that, you know, if his mother says, run, just run. And so he looks at both them and they're all pretty scraped up. And with cuts and bleeding, but his baby brothers just fine, because his mother had tucked him in. And so he asked his mom, like, what happened? And she's like, Oh, I told you to run, like to jump out of the car and run and he's like, No, you didn't? Or, you know, he explained that he was half asleep. And she's like, well, you know, that man wanted to kill us. Right? And, and so he Trevor's like, Oh, why didn't you wake me up, though, you know, at least with them, they would awake, woken me up before he killed me. And she's like, oh, so I should have left you there. But you know, at the end, he understands that you know, he was just to do as he was told and so they wait at the gas station until the police arrive, to drive them home. And while waiting, you know, they sort of talk about like, oh, like mom's like, Oh, thank God that, you know, we're okay, though. Or something along those lines. And Trevor sort of, like, arguing against her. He's like, No, don't thank God, you know, he kind of put us into this mess. Like, why would he put us in harm's way it's, you know, we shouldn't have gone to church. It's sort of God's fault that we went to church and all that you know, it we should have taken the car breaking down as a sign to not go but instead it was the devil that sort of coax us into the situation. And he's like, you know, next time I like we understand you love Jesus, but like next time
