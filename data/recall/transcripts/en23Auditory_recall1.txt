Okay, so the story is taking place in Africa in a party, so like probably the 1970s. So this, there's this nine year old little boy, and his mom and his baby brother, Andrew. And when they're heading out to work for the whitening families, their car won't start. And because the party, they've shut down the public transit, so they have this sketchy like, organized crime bus routes. And so they go to take a walk to the bus station, and they wait for the bus there. But nothing showing up. And it's a really, if you're driving a bus and you steal a bus route from another gangs bus route, then they will kill you because that you just don't do that. And so after waiting for the bus for a really long time, the boys like falling asleep on his feet, because he's really tired. And he doesn't want to go out. And his mom says, Okay, let's hit shape. So they start walking down the road, and they walk for a long time. And then a guy in a car, picks them up and lets them in. And they only drive 10 feet nine feet before one of the buses that they were waiting for squares in front of them cuts him off. And then these two guys come out of the bus was the driver and get in the passenger seat with this big weapon is like a traditional Zulu weapon. It's meant for bashing skulls in and they come up to the driver and they pull them out of the car. And they like why are you stealing their passengers, all this stuff that looked like they were going to kill him. But that would be fairly commonplace in the time. So it wasn't too surprising to the family. And so the mom says, Stop, he was just trying to help us. We'll go with you. We'll take the bus. That's what we wanted to do anyways. So the guys, they, the two guys with the weapon, they leave the car driver alone and they take the family, and they get into this bus. And on the bus. They're the only passengers there. And so you're driving and the driver is going really fast. And he's been talking and he's very angry. And it's kind of like berating the mom. And then he finds out she said there was a woman, we're supposed to like a Zulu woman, they're like considered the Zulu women are considered like, neat, like submissive, like good wives and not to, you know, not promiscuous or anything. And poorer women were considered to be promiscuous and like disobedient. So when this guy finds out that she is a woman he is, it's very angry with her. It's like, oh, like, that explains it and why she's all these things. And he calls her a slut, because she has these two kids, and because she was in a car with a man who wasn't her husband, and she tells them to mind his business. And he gets really angry, and he starts driving even faster. And he's only slowing down to check an intersection just to make sure there's no traffic coming, and then I'll speed up again. And little boy who's like the narrator is kind of falling asleep, because he's so tired, he's not really aware of the situation is happening. And so his mom eventually, is really worried. And she tells him that next time they slow down, he needs to, she's gonna open the door, and he needs to jump out of the door, and then she'll jump after him. But he didn't really hear her because he was dozing off, he's falling asleep. And so they get, they're slowing down. And then the boy isn't jumping. So his mom pushes them out the car door, and she wishes as far as she could and then jumps up after him and she like curls herself around baby Andrew, to kind of protect him as much as possible from the ground. And when the little boy hits the ground, it's very painful and he gets scrapes on his arms and his legs and his knees and he's bleeding everywhere. But his mom tells him to run and so you run and they both run really fast. Apparently his mom was like on a track team to track champion and they just run really, really fast really far in one direction. And the guys in the bus they stopped the bus and they get out and they try to chase them but they can't like they got smoked because then they were so fast and they finally get to a gas station and call the police but by the time they do that the guys were driving the bus were long gone. And so they couldn't do anything there yeah, this is kind of when the boys like adrenaline goes down from before he thought it was just kind of like an animal instinct like a gazelle running from a lion like you didn't think about it. You didn't think about what was happening. He didn't stop and like ask his mother like why Mother? Like, why are we running? What's going on? He just ran. It didn't question anything. Once we got there, he's like, Why did you push me under the bus? He's asking this of his mom. His mom's like, Well, why didn't you jump? He says, You never told me to jump in? She said, Yes, I did. While I was asleep, I didn't hear you. And then his mom is talking about how she's thankful that God saved them. And this kind of sets the boy off. And he he's just like, this wasn't God's plan. You know, I think God's plan was that we were supposed to stay home today when the car wouldn't start. And then his mom goes by how God's plan is, like, brought them where they are. Yeah, and the boy says something funny about God's plan and then the mom laughs Oh, and the baby didn't get any scrapes or anything. Back when the boy was like five like ever since then, when he was little he had kind of learned that. You should like when you see like, helicopters and demands that like the police come in, you should run and hide. And I think he described working for the white people in a party that is like scrubbing floors and cleaning toilets like just menial house labor tasks.
