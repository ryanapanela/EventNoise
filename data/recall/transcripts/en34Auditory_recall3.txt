Okay, so in this story it started by Trevor talking about how he used to spend hours in the salon and lots of money on getting his hair done in cornrows and then for for the ladies attention. And then his mom would look homeless when she was gardening. And then she would go and get ready for church on Sunday mornings and would come out and would look beautiful. And she would make fun of him because he was no longer the prettiest one in the family. And he had to spend all this time and money getting getting ready. And she didn't have to do anything all she had to do a shower. And then from there, he talked about how there was only two men, like he knew that his mom was with her number one was his dad and then his stepdad. I'm assuming his Andrew's dad, Abel and he was a car mechanic and then they got married. And then one day his stepbrother Andrew called him and said that mom had been shot. And then he said that he didn't even have to say who it was because Trevor already knew that it was stepdad. And then he went and got his, I guess his housemate. And then they drove and then he was on the phone with Andrew while you're driving to the hospital, and then he said, he said that she was shot in the leg. And then he felt a relief because he knew that his mom would be stable then and then also said that she was shot in the head. And then you said that he was crying at the traffic light, and he remembers what traffic light it was. And then he got to the hospital and like pulled in and saw Andrew and then he said that like the whole time he was really like calm on the phone and everything. And then the second that they saw each other and you're like started crying. And then they went into the hospital to visit her and she was bandaged up and had gauze on her nose and her eye. And then from there, the nurses and doctors had her sedated and then said like there's nothing left to do like she's like, sedated and stable enough, like go home and get some rest and come back and morning. So then Trevor did. And then he came back and his mom woke up and asked for some water. And then he was crying. And then she said like don't don't like cry. Because like I'm still here, I'm alive, whatever. And then she said, Well, good news. You're now the prettiest one in the family. And then at some point in the story, he also said if Jesus had fanclub she'd be in the top 100. And then he also said that he wished he killed Abel years ago when he had the chance but he didn't know how to kill someone. Which is fair. Oh yeah, that's that's the story.
