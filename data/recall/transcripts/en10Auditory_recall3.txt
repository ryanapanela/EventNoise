Travor's the narrator. Trevor's mom is very pretty. She's the kind of person who's the even though she's going to big, big, I don't know garden, clothing. And she has mud all over her. She's still very pretty. Trevor is the kind of person who. So the story starts with Trevor saying that. In a certain period of time, he was very popular with girls. He used to always go to a hair salon for four hours a week. And his mother would say, I would never date any guy who spends more time the salon as me. And when and usually when she goes to church, she I don't know if she got like, if it's when she goes to church, but she so one time, one time. Like, like, once in like a week, she would dress really pretty, she would just take a shower, but then she was just really pretty even, even though she only took a shower. And so she would say to Trevor, how's it feel being the prettiest one? In the entire week in the family and the entire week, you have to go to the hair salon for four hours to look pretty, but I only took a shower, and then I'm very pretty already. Even though I just took a shower. I didn't go to a hair salon or anything. There were only two men. I mean, Trevor said she probably rejected a lot of men in her life, but but there were only two men around when you know when Trevor was born, so it's basically Trevor's dad and his stepdad. And I don't think Trevor's dad was in the story in any form. So his stepdad that I think his name's Aber and Or Abel, and there wasn't much discussion about him. Andrew, like Andrew is Trevor's stepbrother and I think Andrew is probably the son of Travor's mother and Abel, or Aber years passed by, and, you know, year years passed by people just do their own thing. So Trevor grew up. And one day, he was just, you know, in his own apartment, probably with a roommate. And he just got a call from Andrews. Really, Andrew was really calm was like, weirdly calm. And then he said, mums, how, are you busy? Mom's been shot. And then Trevor thought something was weird with Andrew, because first of all, oh, sorry. And then ignore what I just said about Trevor's thought it was weird. So it's just Andrew said, How, are you busy? Are you busy? So Trevor said what not no what? and then Andrew said mom's been shot. And then Trevor, I thought it was weird, because, first of all, if my mom's been shot, why would you ask me if? If I'm busy, because the first reaction would be mom's been shot instead of are you busy? Because even if, even if Trevor was busy and his mom was shot, he would have still you know, gone to the hospital as fast as possible and abandon anything else that he's doing. And then the second thing Trevor thought was weird. Is that Andrew said mom's been shot in a passive way. The sentence structure is passive, so it doesn't really say who shot him. But then Trevor knew instantly. When Andrew hid the, I guess the subject of who did the shooting. Trevor knew it was Abel, Andrew's dad and Trevor's stepdad who shot his own wife. And then so Trevor just said, Where are you guys? And then Trevor said, you know, a specific hospital name. And then Trevor knocked on his roommates door and said, my mom's best shot. And then the moment I think he was the roommate was really surprised too I think he jumped up probably. And then he jumped up and said, What, and then Trevor just drove to the hospital, which luckily was only like 15 minutes away from his apartment. And then he was just driving and driving until he hit like a traffic light. And he called and then he was calling Andrew. And then Trevor, Trevor thought nothing, you know, it was nothing to fear just because Andrew was like, super calm. And then, when Andrew said, he shot and her mum like Trevor's mom was shot in the leg, Trevor was relieved, because you know, and then but then, Trevor, and Andrew also said, and also in the head, and then Trevor just broke down crying tears washed up his face. He could still remember the exact location of the traffic light, even as he narrates the story, just because it was too memorable. Trevor thought his mum was dead. And he didn't know what to do, because it was always Trevor's mother and him against the whole world. And when Trevor got off the hospital, got off the got off the car and ran to the emergency room. He saw Andrew and once Andrew saw him, Andrew broke down, knowing when he first saw Andrew, Andrew was really calm too but one but once Andrew saw Trevor Andrew broke down into tears, it's like it's like he was waiting for this moment to break down to cry. I mean, he had a mental heal- mental breakdown. But Andrew's cry is more like a hopeless cry. Whereas whereas Trevor's cries more like I think it wasn't a cry of sadness. But I don't remember what kind of a cry it is but it wasn't of sadness. It was of something more, even more so even more. Even bigger, or emotional than sadness. And so Trevor hugged Andrew, and then Trevor just ran to the doctor and the doctor said, There's nothing you can do. She's stable now. Just go home. And then so they did. And the second day, Trevor just went to the bedroom, sorry, went to the hospital. And, you know, the specific room where his mother was staying at. And then she saw He saw his mom who's usually very well dressed and wrote pretty but then she's very fragile, she's frail, she's, she's just pale. And then she has like bandages wrapped around her head, like her eyes. And then he was a he started tear up, and then he was just sitting there holding her hand. And then when his mother opened his eyes open her when his mother opened her eye. The one that was the one without the bandages, you know, covered all over her. Yeah, I mean her. I think the bandage was like covered, was covering her one of her eyes but the other eye that wasn't covered, she opened that eye. And then Trevor just
