He starts off opening up the story about how in Hollywood he never understands how people survive unscathed, when they are hurled out of a car window. And that's kind of his lead into the time he got hurled out of a car window. It's like a flashback kind of story. And he talks about during apartheid. That's how I know the story is taking place in South Africa. And that, and as for the accent, which I was pretty sure sounded kinda Indian, I thought maybe, maybe the story was about like, because there are a lot of Indians in South Africa. So I assume maybe it was like an Indian descent, South African. But anyway. So it's he said it was a Sunday morning his Mom's getting his baby brother Andrew ready, and he's taken a bath himself. And they need to go somewhere. So they leave the house, and they're trying to start the car, but the car will not start. And he briefly talks about how the bus system is and in that area. It's like, all favored towards white people. And because it's apartheid and everything. White people still need, you know, black people to do their menial laborers and stuff. And the major transportation routes weren't always really good for black people, or people of South Africa. I say black but the accent is Indian. The Africans have their own sort of their own bus path. So they have this mini bus system, where people like, and each route is sort of claimed by a driver. So if another driver tries to interfere with that route, and pick passengers along that route, things get violent. So that's like the one thing like you're getting these rides from these, like, from like a private driver catered towards the black citizens. But there's a lot of like violence involved. Especially if one driver is trying to steal the route of another. That's the whole thing about the bus system. But anyway, um, so the narrator, his mom and Andrew, realize they can't get the car started. They're waiting, looking for a mini bus and they get into some guy's car. And the guy starts driving with him partway through the car is like cut off by this mini bus. Because I'm assuming it's probably like that mini bus's versus route. So a little more details. These guys are like, the main characters are all Xhosa people, Zulu and Xhosa. And I think one of the kids is half white. And the Xhosa people, especially the women are mistreated and heavily judged. There's many books like stops in front of this car, and two people get out. One guy or both of them have these clubs, traditional Zulu weapons, and they drag the guy that's driving the car out and shove the clubs in his face. Threaten him and ask him why he's like stealing the customers but the mom, she speaks up and she's like, you know, just try and defuse the situation. She's like, No, we're actually looking for a bus driver will come with you don't need to do anything. That guy is like left alone and Narrator his brother, baby brother, Andrew and the mom get into the minibus drivers like bus. So they're driving along and the mini bus driver, he proceeds to act kind of like a lot of other bus drivers. So apparently a lot of mini bus drivers, they just complain and complain and complain and harass passengers while they're on the thing. So there's many buses like empty except for these guys, and they're on there. And this guy is like berating the mom telling her how she shouldn't have gotten into a car alone with the man. And she's telling him off like just mind your own business. And that's like infuriating him. And then he starts calling her slut. And that like all Xhosa women are like this. And then eventually he starts threatening her and says you'll see what happens to you tonight. So the narrator's worried that they could get killed, the mom could get raped something like that. And so he's like, at this point, he's not really where he is. He's almost falling asleep, but his mom is like, in overdrive. And she's trying to, like, settle the situation. And she's like, Look, I'm sorry, if I offended you, why don't you just drop us off here, you don't need to take us all the way. And the guy refuses. She keeps trying to tell him to like start, but he won't. So she was supposed to her son is falling asleep, look at the next time they slow down, you need to jump. But he's like falling asleep, so he does not hear her. So she makes up her mind. She at the next time that many of us slows down, he grabs her son, throws them out of the window of the minibus and wraps her baby son Andrew, up in her like shawl. And then she jumps out herself. They're a little bit bruised, but baby Andrew was completely fine. But as soon as like her older son, the narrator gets up, the mom has like, run, and so they just run for their lives. And the mom was like some running champion back in her college days or something. And so the mini bus drivers are not able to catch up, and they just like, give up. And they end up running to a 24 hour gas station, and they call the police. Him and his mom are having a conversation. He's like, he's angry. He doesn't know why he got thrown out of the vehicle. And his mom's like they were gonna kill us. And he's like, Well, you couldn't have like, told me and she's like, I tried to tell you and I Why didn't you jump and he's like, I was I was sleeping or I was falling asleep. And she's like, What should I have done like, left you in there? And he's like, at least they would have like, woken me up before killing me. And then, you know, he's still angry. And he is like, when the car didn't start the morning, that was the devil telling us that we should not be going anywhere and you ignore the devil. And he lured us out and like other ways, and she's like, No, it's not the devil. It's God. God has a plan. And if we're meant to be here, then it's because God wanted us to be here. There's a reason for it. And he wraps it up by just saying next time God wants us somewhere. Why don't you just have Jesus come to the house? Kind of makes a joke, lightens the mood, and then him and his mother laugh. He's just talking about how like, you hope things are gonna change but things really never are going to change and now they're just waiting for the police to drive them home.
