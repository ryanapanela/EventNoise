So in the story, Trevor's talking about how in the movies, the characters get thrown out of cars. And you know, within a few seconds, they just jump up as if they're completely fine. And nothing has happened to them. And he thinks that that's not a good depiction of how that actually goes since he's actually been thrown out of a car. So he's has personal experience. So he then starts talking about his experience with being thrown out of a car is that he is supposed to be leaving with his mom and his baby brother. And they get into the car, and the car doesn't actually start. So they end up having to take the minibus, which in South Africa is a bus that's not regulated. So there's a bunch of different rival companies that have different routes that these mini buses are supposed to go on. So they go in there, waiting at the bus stop for a very long time, and there's no mini bus in sight. So his mum ends up saying, hey, let's just go hitchhike. So they start walking, until a car pulls up and picks them up. So they get into the car. They're driving. And all of a sudden, a minibus, comes from behind and swerves in front of them, and the driver of the minibus gets out and starts yelling at them at the driver of the car there and saying that he's not allowed to be taking them anywhere, because they should be on the minibus. So Trevor's mom tells them that it's fine. They'll hop on their minibus, so they get onto the minibus with the two kids. And the driver of the minibus starts saying, really mean things to his mom, that she's a whore. And she, because she has a son that's half black. And that he's basically going to end up killing her. So in the midst of all this, Trevor, who is nine years old, is falling asleep, because he's very tired in the car, and his mom leans over and tells him that at the next intersection, when the car slows down, he should open the door and jump out. And then she will also jump out with his baby brother, Andrew. But because he's asleep, he doesn't actually hear anything that she says. So when the car does get to the next intersection and slows down, she ends up opening up opening up the door, and just pushing Trevor out, and then she brings Andrew really close to her wraps him up in her arms. And then she also jumps out. And he sort of wakes up at that point, after he's been thrown out of the car. And he hears his mum saying run. So all he knows is that at this point, he has to run. So they both start running. And the driver and the other person in the minibus with them starts running after them. But they don't actually end up catching up to them, because there's so much faster so they end up actually escaping from them. And he Trevor finally realizes, it looks down and he sees that he's all scraped up and there's blood running all over his body from when he jumped out and same with his mom. And he says to his mom, you know, why did we have to, to run and she says, Oh, because those guys were going to kill us. And he says, you know, we should have listened when God told us that we shouldn't have left this morning, and that's why the car wasn't running in the first place.
