Yeah, the story was about about how narrator would watch like, Hollywood movies, and they would see like, guys get like, thrown out, or like, they would like, jump out of the moving car, and how they would all be fine. And then he always thought, you know, that can't be the case. And like, the story transitions to about how his mother, the narrator, and his brother were going to, I'm not sure which they were going to, but they were going to trying to go somewhere, but their car wouldn't work. And then, but even though their car wouldn't work, they still needed to get there. And he talked about how, you know, even though, obviously, there weren't many, like, accessible, I guess, transit systems, because they were, like black and like apartheid South Africa, like white people would still expect them to, you know, clean their houses or, you know, do jobs and such. And so there'll be, naturally, there was a development of like this, I guess, black market transit system where, like, it was essentially like, like a black market, or like a underground market. And it was kind of like, I guess, illegal in a sense, but there'll be like, routes created by, like, private, I guess a mini bus groups, and they would, they would often be violent, since I guess it was like, not regulated. And, you know, like, if you I think he gave an example about how if, like, one guy steals another man's route, like, they could end up, like, just killing the person that steals the route, since, you know, they're taking customers away from like the first guy. So the idea was that, you know, these scenarios could be really dangerous and violent, but they still went into this, like mini bus, since, you know, they needed to get there, the narrator talked about, like, how he was, like, really sleepy before going there as well, and like, throughout the ride, like, on this mini bus, you know, he was sleepy. I think they got into like a random guy's car. I'm not sure if he was part of, like a, like a private mini bus business, but like, while they were driving on to like, a destination, like, I think the minibus people came by and got like mad at the guy that was driving them, and they had, like, I'm not sure what. I don't know if he said, like, dulu or something, but like, they have like, a traditional, like, weapon, like a club, and like, they were essentially, like, threatening this guy, and like getting mad at him. And like, they were essentially, like beating him up. But then his mother, the narrator's mother, like, was like, you know, just talked about how she wanted to get to the place, and it's like, just, you know, you guys could drive us here and we'll pay or something. And that kind of convinced the minibus people to, like, Stop harassing the guy. And then they just got into this mini busses, the mini busses car, and throughout the ride, or, like, he also talked about how, like, the drivers are, like, notorious for kind of like, harassing the customers, since, again, it's like, customers, since, again, it's like, not regulated, and they're not really, like proper, I guess, in a sense. And essentially, the driver got mad about how, you know, his mother was just in like, a random man's car without, like, her husband or something. And he talked about how there was, like, historically, some issue with, like, Xhosa people and like to do, I think, and they're like, so essentially, kind of, like, different, I guess, groups, or like, yeah, they have a bit of conflict. And when they found out, or the driver found out that his mom was a Xhosa person, like, you know, there's like, I guess, tension. So he, like, started, like, talking about her in like, a really horrible way, like, about how she's, like, a whore or something. And especially because the narrator is, like, he's mixed, he's mixed race. You know, that made it worse. I guess, the driver talked about how, you know, the mom was, like, really terrible. And the narrator talked about how the mother wasn't like, a type of person to, like, I guess, take, you know, really bad, like, just, she wasn't the type to, like, just hear horrible things about her and, like, not say anything. So I guess she was like, in like, she started, like, talking back, and then that kind of, like, pissed off the drivers. I don't know if just the, I guess the driver's end, yeah. And then I guess the driver says something alongside lines of, like, I'm going to teach you a lesson and like, you know you're going to learn to like, I guess you're going to learn your lesson yet. And then he started just driving off really fast and, like, without like, a care in the world, and trying to, like, essentially, the narrator talked about, he didn't know what was going to happen, but he thought like it could have been, like, just like they could both get, like they could all get murdered, or like it could have been rape or whatever. And it's like, really, yeah, it's like, a really scary moment. But in the moment, at least, the narrator was still sleepy, I guess, and he wasn't really aware of what was happening throughout this, right? The mom tells the narrator that, like, they have to, like, get out. They have to, like, just, like, jump out. Because, like, she already, like, kind of said sorry to the guy, and like, tried to make things better. But, you know, the driver isn't listening. He's he's still threatening her, essentially. So the mom throws the narrator outside, like the car window, I think, and then carries the carries his brother with, like, his little brother with her, and like, in like a ball, so she would protect the child, like the little brother, and they, like, both just jumped out, yeah. And then once they jumped out, I guess to him, since he was like, confused and dazed, he doesn't, didn't really know what was going on, but like, the mother told him to, like, run, and then he started running. And like, the mother did the same thing. And he talked about how he it felt like a dream, and like the pain didn't really get to him since, yeah, I guess he was, like, still dazed. And he talked about how like running, or like, it was really instinctual to him. And like, he talked about how, like, I don't remember specific examples, but he talked about, I think, like, helicopters and stuff, and how like, like, I guess apartheid, like, he had to, like, like, I guess, defend himself, or like, running, running away and stuff. So like, it felt natural to him. And they were like, really, they were all really fast. And even though the driver of the mini bus, like, came out and tried to chase them, like, you know, they just smoked them and couldn't catch up, yeah, once, like, they were, I think, in like a safe place, like, like a police station and like a petrol you have, like, a petrol stop, he, like, kind of, like, argued with his mom about how, like, you know, why did you, like, throw me outside, like the car window that, like, really hurt, because he wasn't really aware of, you know, why she did that and why, I mean, I think she told him, but he was again, I guess, still sleeping was really confused. And they kind of got into argument about that, but the mom told him, like, you know, they would have killed us, like we had to get out. And yeah. And they also talked about how, or, like, she says a remark about how, you know, it was probably, like, God's will. Or, like, you know, even though it's horrible, God probably put us in this situation for a reason. But then the narrator talks back to her, saying something along the line of, like, No, you should have probably listened to like, you know, God's will in the beginning, when the car wasn't working and just not went to this place at all, because, like, it was like devils doing, you know, like with the mini busses and stuff. And they had an argument, argument about that. And it just Yeah. Yeah. But throughout the pain, I think, you know, even though they're still arguing, they like, kind of just like, I think he's they have, like, a little joke or something, and then they, like, end up just laughing and just, I guess, even though they're covered in blood and like, they're, yeah, they're bleeding, except for the little brother, since he was protected by his mother, like they laughed through the pain, and I think that's where the story ends.
