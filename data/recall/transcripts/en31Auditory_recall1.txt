So it starts off, and the guy is saying, in Hollywood, some stunt doubles. Something about jumping out of a car or getting hit by a car is painful. He's like, No jumping on a car is definitely more painful. And then talks about growing up in South Africa mentioned something about the apartheid and how governments weren't running things. So things like buses became like a community thing, unregulated bus system that the community put together, they would run their own mini buses. But since it was unregulated, it was unreliable and didn't often run on time, and was often dangerous. It was considered criminal activity. And then he goes on to tell stories about one time, there was criminal activity, the bus routes kind of became monopolized, like kind of gang activities where you wouldn't take somebody else's route. Because then you would get jumped and get attacked for stealing their route or taking over someone else's route. One time him and his mom were waiting for a bus and it didn't come. So then this guy offered to give them a ride. So they got into that mini bus, and then another many of us, cut them off on the road, and jumped down and started attacking the driver, because it was their route. And then the mom was like, it's fine. We were we just wanted to take this route anyway, we'll get into your mini bus. So they got into that mini bus of the guy who was attacking them. And then they just went away. There was something about them being Xhosa community or Xhosa. And racial tensions with that. When they were in the minibus, the driver kept ignoring or like being dismissive to  and then the mom. And it got to the point where he started like, verbally assaulting them and said something like, that's the problem with you Xhosa women. You're going to learn a lesson today to the mom and then like, started speeding, and sped off and only stopped at intersections to check if they can clear it, but just kept driving fast. The mom was like, Oh, my God, no, let us out. Because she was thought that they were going to either like rape her or kill them. But the driver just kept speeding away. So the mom and her two sons are in the back, she told the older son who was nine at the time, I think that at the next intersection when the driver slows down to jump out of the car. But the son was too sleepy and tired, and just kind of want to fall asleep in the car. But then, when the minibus slow down next intersection, mom opened the sliding door, pushed the nine year old son out and also jumped out with the baby in her arms. The oldest son hit the ground was in total shock, saw the mom fall beside him. And then she said run. And then he was still don't give us but full of adrenaline and whatever. So he started running. The moms are running. The kidnappers tried to chase them, but they were like really fast. Something about some type of champions or like best runners of some sort. I don't know. I guess they didn't expect the mom and the baby or the mom and the kid to be such good runners. Eventually, the man who kidnapped them gave up running. The son said he remembered turning back and seeing them give up. They kept running until they got to 24 hour gas station or something like that. And the son was like, why are we running? And the moms like we were just about to be kidnapped. And then the son was like, what? Why don't you tell me and then I was like I told you to jump. And he was like, No, you pushed me out. I was asleep. He didn't realize that they were being kidnapped and the mom was actually saving his life. By the time they got to the gas station and like settle down for a bit, the son realized how much pain he actually was in from jumping out of the car or being pushed out of the car. He's like arms and I think legs were all scratched up and the skin was torn. Same with the mom, but the baby brother was kind of relatively unscathed was fine because the mom like curled around him to jump out. And then the mom was like, okay, thank God that you're safe and And then the nine year old was like no, not thank God like it's the devil who tricked us to get into that van. If the car didn't start it that was God telling us to stay home and started having an argument with his mom at the gas station, about Jesus. And then he said next time, tell teachers to come meet us at home. And they waited at the gas station until the police came in
