The story starts with a boy named Trevor who has cornrows, and this makes him very attractive to the ladies of his age. He theorizes why this is the case, thinking maybe it's because the chicks dig a man who takes care of himself, and then his mom is a bit the polar opposite of Trevor, who takes a different approach to looking good. She will allegedly spend six days of the week going about the house in homeless clothing, to quote her son. And then on Sunday, she will get into her Sunday best and look beautiful. The story starts with that idea of a mother and son who are very close to each other, and there's a joke about beauty and taking care of oneself and putting time into one's appearance. The story then deviates into the meat of the matters, where there's a Volkswagen, and this Volkswagen breaks down, and they take it to a shop where there's a man named Abel. He's attractive, but not conventionally So, but in a way that is attractive to Trevor's mother. So Trevor's mother starts bringing in the Volkswagen at times where it's not that broken to see Abel. And eventually they get married, not in a conventional wedding, but in terms of signing papers. When Trevor is nine, his baby brother is born named Andrew. I think it's Andrew, and as the older brother of nine years, he doesn't really care. He doesn't change the diapers. He goes and plays arcade plays arcade games. After playing these games, he becomes a comedian in the future and moves away from the family. He's sleeping 15 minutes away from a hospital one day where he receives a call from his brother, Andrew, who is very calm. Andrew asks, Are you busy? And our main guy, Trevor, responds, yeah, I was busy sleeping. But and Andrew drops the bombshell of the news that their mother has been shot. There isn't any further elaboration on who shot the mother, as I suppose, there was prolonged spousal abuse, and Trevor knew that it was Abel. So Trevor gets into his car, drives 15 minutes to the hospital and on the way, I suppose they're still talking the two brothers, Andrew elaborates more into how that happened in a flashback memory, they were coming home, and Abel was standing on the doorsteps. Or no, he was waiting for them, and then he came out of his car and shot the mother once in the leg and then once in the head.Upon hearing that his mother had been shot in the head, Trevor cries a lot, and he elaborates into his emotions and why, which I don't quite recall, but I do recall that he was crying out of pain and anger, so he cries at a random stoplight, and he continues driving while crying. He gets to the hospital and the brothers meet. Trevor comments that Andrew looked very calm, but that was up until the moment where I think they hugged. Maybe they didn't hug, but I think they hugged that would make sense for the story. And then Trevor, or then Andrew, begins crying out of helplessness. So they cry. Then Trevor eventually goes to go visit his mother, who is still alive, and he waits there for an hour before the mother opens up her single eye, which was not bandaged, and they have a good heart to heart, where the mother comforts Trevor, saying, Hey, don't cry. I wasn't going to die. I'm okay. And Trevor expresses that he should have done something to prevent this outcome. So I think he said that he should have injured or killed Abel. But then the I suppose, conclusion of the story is where Trevor's mother counters with hey, on the bright side, now that I'm shot, you are the best looking person in the family. Circling back to the opening of the story, where they're talking about who's the best looking person in the family, and putting time into your appearance.
