So the story was talking about this guy who was recalling his experience with getting into a car accident. I think it was on a Sunday, he was supposed to go pick up his baby brother from somewhere. And he was with his mom as well. And he started with just describing how, like, what the scenario was for the, for the situation. And he said that there's like a lot of buses and a lot of stuff like that on the road. And it's very unregulated. And I think he called the entire situation almost like organized crime, because it's, it's very unregulated, and very, like, there's no really like policing or anything going on. And then he was talking about how he was in the, I think, for certain sentences, he changed his accent a bit. And I think he spoke about, like South African people being involved in the whole altercation. Well, I'm not sure who was South African but he was in the car with his mom. And then they were in a minibus, and somebody got out of the car or the bus across from them. And then they shoved somebody else onto the head of the car. And then they started shouting at them. And he was very shaken up about that. And then his, his mom and him, they were driving. And they were trying to run away from the mobsters from the from the people that were sort of chasing them. And then there was a point where he was sleeping in the car in the minibus, I think. And while he was sleeping, his his mom suddenly opened the door next to him and shoved him out of the running car. And he woke up, like, on his way out of the car, like when he was he woke up while he was like, on the ground outside. And then he was like, what is happening, but I think his mom was still in the car. And she was actually trying to save his life because they were being followed and stuff like that. And then I think the car itself got into an accident. And then his mom sort of escaped that, or she, I think she either escaped, or she got super injured. And she just almost flew out of the car. And then she, I think he said the phrase that my mom suddenly landed next to me. And he was really confused. And I think his little brother was there as well. Like the the brother also got saved. And then the guy went into a little monologue where he was like, if I had another childhood, I would be very useless standing there as a five year old child and just being like, if I saw like people chasing us, and if I saw that I was being kicked out of a moving van while I was sleeping, and I was five years old and alternative childhood, I would have been like, Mom, what's happening? What do I do, but because of my circumstances, because of my experiences, I knew exactly what's happening. And I knew how to handle myself. And that was really important, especially for the area that I live in, like where I live in I'm not sure where he said he lived in maybe San Francisco, but that might be a complete mistake. Might just be me making it up, but whatever. And then he his mom and him, they walked to a nearby 24/7 petrol station like a gas station. And that's when he started shouting at his mom being like, What the hell was that? What were you doing? Why did you throw me out of the minibus and his mom said that those guys were coming to kill us. And he said that he was too angry because he was thrown out of the bus to realize that his mom saved his life. And then he cracked a joke. And then both of them started laughing. And they got the police involved so they were waiting for the police to arrive at the scene and then they were just standing at the petrol station laughing and that's where the that's where the story sort of closes. That's the last scene from but yeah, I think that's it. I'm just thinking of any additional details that I can remember.Yeah, I think that's it.
