Okay, so the narrator's talking about growing up in South Africa, and how it's difficult to take public transit, because the bus routes, I guess they're owned privately by like these groups that are very violent. And they, you know, you don't want to cross them. Or if you know, one of them, like steals the others bus route, they could be killed and they get violent. And so one day, his he's trying to go somewhere with his mom and baby brother Andrew, and their car breaks down. So then they kind of have to take one of these mini buses. No, they don't take a mini bus. Initially, they carp, they try to like hitchhike. And as they're hitchhiking, they get pulled over by one of the many buses and the driver comes over and like, he has like, some sort of big weapon. And he pulls the driver out and says, you know, why are you stealing my customers? And, and the mother says, you know, that's fine, we'll just don't hurt him, we'll go with you. So then they get into the minibus, and the bus driver is insulting the mother saying like, you know, forget the group that she's with, but like, basically her background saying that she's like, the woman who's like a whore and who, you know, doesn't, too, like outspoken. Basically insulting her for being a strong woman. And she. Yeah, the bus driver now, I guess, starts speeding up and scares this family, mother and the two sons. And so they come up with a plan. At the next light, they're going to basically roll jump out of the vehicle, bus. So the mother throws the narrator out out of the bus, and he was like, rolls down on the concrete and kind of scratches up as his arms and legs. And then she tumbles out after him holding the baby brother. And they start running till they get to like a petrol station. And that's where they, you know, he's wondering, like, what just happened? And sorry. Yeah, and then they sort of have this like disagreement about, you know, God because his mom is saying, like, you know, that everything happens for a reason. This is God's plan and the narrator saying that this is more of the work of the devil. And they argue back and forth and then he's like, then they start laughing because I don't know. Yeah, that's how the story ends. I don't remember
