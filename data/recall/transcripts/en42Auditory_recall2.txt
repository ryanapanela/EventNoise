The story begins with our main guy, Trevor. He introduces three Chinese students that he met in ninth grade, Bolo, Bruce Lee and John. Bolo's parents were pirates, and I don't quite know, or quite remember where he got his name from. In ninth grade, all the kids were very fascinated with Bruce Lee's name, because that was his real name. This shy, quiet Asian guy, Bruce Lee. Dang, that's funny. And then John was just John. There wasn't much said about him, and I suppose they found his name a little it was just John, but the meat of the story goes when I don't quite remember how it transitioned, but it was about Bolo. His parents were pirates, so he was a pirate, and kind of he took in Playstations and added a chip, and the chip allowed people to play pirated PlayStation games. He would then sell PlayStation games to people in a great model of giving people, I guess, capital and then allowing them to No, that's actually not right. Never mind. So going back, bolo worked with some guy named Andrew, who is white. This becomes important later in the story. But Andrew, he wasn't a PlayStation pirate, he was a CD burner, or I think they called it CD writing. What he would do is he had a computer and he could put music onto that CD and then sell that CD for less than what stores were selling them for. So he profited it by cutting profit from the bigger stores. I think it was he sold them for $30 I'm not sure what dollars they were using, but the store sold them for 100 I think either that or 150 but the conflict in this story emerges because Andrew and Bolo were scared of black kids. Whoa. This was because the black people learned, as the story says, that they could say they would pay later and not really pay. So that's bad for business. So Trevor gets hired as the middleman in this operation after he offers to be the intermediary, because he is not scared of black people. So this business arrangement is the three of them, Bolo Andrew and Trevor, he they make great money. But later in the story, one year later, Bolo is he just disappears. The rumor is that his parents got arrested for piracy, and then something happened to him. And then Andrew, he was two years older, so he graduated what they were ninth grade. So he graduated the year after two, and he gave up his pirating business. So then Andrew bequeaths the copywriter to our main guy this entire time, using the cut of profits he had from this, from this operation, he was upgrading his own computer. He got some help from Andrew and adding more memory. And something else that I couldn't make out, but so he took over the operation with the one times cop, CD writer. It was called CD writer, CD writer, um, and he just continued the business. He also improved the business model with his profits by what did he do? He put different he made, I think, like mixes. I don't know if you call it a mix tape, because a CD is not a tape, but he made different playlists for the songs, and he hired his own middlemen, whose names I do not recall. I think one was Mulaney or bulani. However, it has been lost to time. Then what happens is, his assistant suggests, hey, what if we had like transitions and then like the beats would also match up. So he downloads like something about beats per minute, and he can find the beats per minute and match it up and create party lists, and, yeah, he describes the demand for his music. There was a lot of South African music, and there was a lot of American music. I think it was R and B and hip hop that had a lot of interest. He said he wasn't too interested in music before this. He was a very solid Christian song type of fellow because it was the only type of music that his mother would allow. But he didn't really listen to the music he was copying for other people because he didn't want to indulge in his stock, as the dealers would say. Moving forward into this story, moving forward, yeah, he makes profits. He reinvests those profits, and then I think he concludes this story by telling us or thanking Andrew for allowing him to have that writer, as without the writer, he would not have been able to make any business despite the fact that Trevor is business minded. So he goes on to elaborate about the importance of empowering or giving the fishing pole to people, because then it would allow them to fish after being taught. So there was discussion on how Andrew was white. So there was some race dynamic in his story, where Andrew had the ability to afford a computer and a $2,000 copywriter, which was the cost of, at that time, Trevor's setup for his computer. So it was an affordability and accessibility equity issue. So he concludes with that anecdote, saying that people miss the point when they say that handouts are useless, or saying that giving money to people is somehow counter intuitive to the goal of empowering them, because you need the capital and the skills to make profit and if not given either of the two, it does not occur.
