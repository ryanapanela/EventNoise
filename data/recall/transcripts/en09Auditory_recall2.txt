The narrator started saying that he started to, or he never really went on dates in high school until he got his hair permed or he got cornrows in them. And he thought that the reason why he started going on dates afterwards was that the woman started to be attracted to him because of that, but also because maybe they were appreciating or they liked the idea that he was spending more time doing his hair than them, so that he understands how hard it is. He then started talking about how his mother was a very attractive woman. She works Monday to Saturday, and on Sunday, she goes to church. And they were always very playful with each other. They would always, like, have these snarky jabs at each other. So through Monday to Saturday, his mom would look kind of dirty, because she works in a garden. But on Sunday, when she goes to church, she would take a shower. And she would look a lot prettier. And the narrator said that it was kind of weird. Like no one wants to speak about their mother like this. Just cause it's a little weird, but you said that it is the matter of fact that she was a very pretty and attractive woman. And like her, his mom would make jokes about make jokes to him about how he has to spend like four hours a week or four hours, four hours a week at the hair salon getting his hair done. hair straightened and then cornrows put in where all she needs to do is take a shower, and she'd look prettier than him. And so she was saying that he can be the prettier one or the more good looking one for six days of the week. But on Sunday she is more good looking than him. And I think he was saying around high school or when he was 15 he, they would go to a mechanic. Oh, he was saying that his mom only loved two people truly in her life, which is his father and his stepfather. And so he, there was one time where he went with his mom to a mechanic which was around the corner of some street nearby and and yeah, they would get the car fixed. And the car was broken down quite often. So they would always come back to the mechanic where they met a cool guy named Abel and eventually it felt as if they were going even when their car was completely fine. And then eventually, they got married. And one year after they had gotten married Abel and his mom. He had a little baby brother named Andrew and so he would take care of him. The, Abel Abel was a handsome man, but not good looking. And that's what his mother liked. That type of ugly is what she likes. And so eventually, one day Andrew, called his brother or Trevor, the narrator. He woke up in the morning. Look, looked at his phone, and it was his mother calling flashing on the screen. And when he answered the phone, it was actually his brother Andrew. And he sounded very calm. Asking Trevor, how are you? Are you free right now? And Trevor said, yeah, why? What's up? I just woke up. And Andrew said that his mother or their mother got shot. And so he, Trevor was very worried and very shocked and rushed to the hospital. He jumped out of bed and got ready immediately. And I, he went with someone, I think it was his roommate. Or maybe another family member, they went together and drove up to the hospital. And so when they got into the car he called Trevor. Trevor called Andrew back asking what had happened. But Trevor said that there was like two things wrong with the phone call one was that what if his mother got shot? Why would the first thing be to ask how are you? The first thing you should say is that your mother got shot? And secondly, he was very calm. So he assumed that his mother was okay. I think that was the second thing that he said. And but yeah, he called back his brother. And asked what had happened. His brother responded very calmly saying that they were coming back home from church. And Abel was in the in the in the driveway with his gun, and he started shooting, and he shot her in the leg. And so Trevor thought that that was okay
