Story starts with Trevor recalling with very specific time from his childhood, where he was two or three Chinese students are admitted into school. And he talks about how, because they're kids, they think it's really cool how one of the kids is named Bruce Lee. And around that time, it's like a very big piece of like iconography like Asian media in the Western world, but just like someone that children thought was really cool. It lasted a long time, like from the 80s, even like to the late 2010. They talked about two, two of these students, two of the Chinese students they redistributed the CDs to the class or they start selling them to the classmates. And Trevor, he was friends with them. He hears them talking about how they don't like the black students in their class. Because they say oh, I'll pay you back later and they just don't. And these two students are scared of these black students and then Trevor or no, it was one of their other friends like these two Chinese students. Their names, I think one of them was named Bruce Lee, and another one was named John. So Bruce, and John, they're talking. And one of them says or Trevor, or it's one of these students. I'm really not sure who said this. But all of the black students in the class don't have money, so they can't really afford to get the CDs. Trevor learns how to over write CDs and DVDs. And so he starts distributing them to the students as well. And he starts to make a little money off selling these CDs. Then starts to learn more and more about piracy. Audio piracy, media piracy, overwriting CDs, and redistributing them to his classmates. He talks about how with what was what were the most popular pieces of music to put on the CDs, he talks about how South African music was big, people were listening to it, but black American music was really what was like very big at the time. Very big piece of what everybody wanted on physical media. He's talking about his brother, Andrew, was his friend. He helps him get more integrated just more like I guess advanced, or more efficient and redistributing these CDs downloading the files on the CDs, rewriting these CDs. And he talks about how this was like, a pretty good moment for him a childhood because he felt like he was really cool he was getting a lot of money. He was talking about how he had his phone, he was hanging out his friends. He said he was going in McDonald's and as a kid like that made him feel like really cool and made him feel really special. And he was talking about how he really needed Andrews help, because he didn't realize that what I didn't and probably wouldn't have been able to get as far as he did with that was something so minuscule even just like redistributing CDs for his classmates. And at the end, he talks about how he talks about the allegory with or the metaphor. If you take a man fishing, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for life. But he adds that when people mention that metaphor, they don't talk about how you also need to give the man a fishing rod. Talking about how it doesn't matter if you give somebody the mental resources to perform a task, the physical resources would also probably help too.
