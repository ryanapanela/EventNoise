The speaker starts off talking about three Asian students that have just transferred to a school. Bolo, Bruce Lee, and John, they were the only three kids in this. And they were the only three international kids in the school. And bolos parents were pirates. And that they would pirate games, TV shows, movies. And then bolo took after his parents and how. And he started his own business in the school. And then he partnered partnered up with Andrew, who had a CD writer. And those two were having difficulties with the black kids in school because they would take advantage of them and never pay them. And then the speaker joins them in their business venture as the middlemen and then Bala leaves their partnership, because the rumor is that his parents got arrested. So then it's just Andrew and speaker. And then the face door for business, just Andrew and him. And then Andrew leaves eventually and it's just up to the speaker. And he starts selling his own CDs after getting Andrew CD writer because Andrew gave it to him. And then he hires two more people Tom and Moog or something with an M name. And then mulgara starts suggesting that they make they sell mix CDs, and with certain songs from an album rather than the whole album. And then those sell out pretty well as well as party mixes. And then he starts talking about how none of it would have been possible without Andrew and how Andrew was white, and he had the privilege and the resources whereas his people were not given the same and he talks about how he talks about the you give a man to fish an analogy where if you give a man to fish, he'll eat it in a day. Whereas if you teach him to fish, he'll survive on his own. And what that analogy misses is that if you need a fishing rod and then he talks about how none of it would have been possible without Andrew Oh yeah
