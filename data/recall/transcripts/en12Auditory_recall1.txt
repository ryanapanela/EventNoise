The male narrator starts off the story by saying, just in general, how good looking he is, and the time and effort that he puts into his physical appearance and how he has confidence and is able to approach dates. Then he starts to explain how him and his mom would tease each other about how good looking they are and the effort that they put into their physical appearances. He explains how his mother wouldn't really put too much effort during the week, but every time come Sunday, before they go to church, that's when she puts in effort and teases her son saying how she's better looking now. Whereas the son would take a lot of time, every day throughout the week, to put an effort into his physical appearance. He then just talks about his mother his relationship with his mother, and mentions how she is an attractive person and how she would have had like, male attention from several men, but just mentions how there have been two men in their lives together. One is his father, and then his stepfather. The narrator mentions how, after he turns his nine, that's when he gets a younger brother. So it is now him and his younger brother. The narrator then explains how he's in a different city, I believe, for school or work. And it's, it's the morning and he gets a phone call. And the caller ID was his mother but it was his brother that is talking through the phone. The narrative explains how the brother initially asked, you know how the narrator's doing and the narrator didn't really think much of it. But then the brother says how their mother has been shot. The narrative explains how the brother was very calm when he said this. And just assume that she's just been shot, just mentions the hospital that their at. And the narrator was just explaining how it was just kind of weird that the brother started off the conversation by asking how things were instead of just saying right away that their mother has been shot. The narrator then hangs up the phone tells him that he's gonna be coming, he wakes up, I believe his roommate or tells his roommate, that his mother has been shot. So he ends up quickly getting ready and starts driving to the hospital, which I believe he said was about 15 minutes away. As he's driving, he calls his brother again and is like screaming on the phone asking what happened? And then he talks about how she's been shot. Before this. The narrator doesn't even ask who shot their mom because he already assumed that it was their father. But then back in the car when he's talking to his brother for the second time, the brother explains how they went to church. And then after church, they went back home. And then they saw their father outside and then he started shooting the narrative asked the brother where was she shot? The brother mentions that the father shot her in the leg. And then after how he kept on shooting, and that she was also shot in the head. This is where, when the narrator broke down crying was very angry and upset. And that he eventually was able to get To the hospital as he drove through the specific detail he mentioned was how there was just so much tears and he couldn't really see but as the traffic light turned green, he was able to drive through his tears. Once he got there, he saw his brother and his brother just broke down crying was very, very upset about the turn of events. The narrator notices all that. Then the narrator goes to see his mother in the ICU, the intensive care unit and can see that her head, the back of her head is all wrapped up and one of her eyes is wrapped up in bandages. And the doctor explains how she has been put under and that she is in stable condition. The doctor has told them, the brothers to just go home and rest because there's nothing that they can do right now. The narrator mentions how the next day he comes back to the hospital to stay with his mom sees that she is still asleep and waits by her. The narrator mentions how an hour later. Before this, the nadir mentions how he has so much anger for his father and started contemplating how he would kill his father. And then also thinks about how he's not capable of doing such a thing. But there's emotions and anger led him to think this. And then afterwards, the mother wakes up in an hour. She was pretty much in a very light positive mood. You can see her smiling through the one eye that isn't bad aged. That's the eye though, is woken up that as that opens, and then the mother and the narrator are talking the narrator surprises to see why. You know, she's laughing and you know, taking it very lightly, was saying how you know, she almost died. And then the mother is just explained to her son that like you know, she isn't dead. The narrator also explains how she's very religious always prays. When it comes to people that pray, Jesus would know of her because of how much you praise. And then the mother just assures her son, the narrator that you know, she's not dying today. She's not dead. And to kind of just look on the bright side. The mother just mentioned to look on the bright side. They'll just a little bit more of an exchange between a narrator and the mother at the hospital.
