Okay, um, his mum and him and his baby brother were going out one night, and the car wouldn't start. So I don't remember where they were going. But they, his mum decided that they would go and take one of the buses, but for black people, they weren't allowed on the regular public transit. So there was organized crime, essentially, which was designated drivers and routes for black people. But there was a lot of violence. And if people tried to take over somebody else's route, then it would result in violence. And so it was, yeah, just not a great situation. They were waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and the bus was coming. So they decided, or his mom decided that they would walk and hitchhike. So they did, and then a car picked them up. And then as they were driving along in the car, a mini bus pulled in front of them, came out with clubs and pulled the driver out of the car and started beating him. And asking him, why are they taking their customers, or asking the driver, why are they taking their customers. And then the mom said, Stop. This is like we were trying to get with you, we'll come with you. And they get in the car. And then the driver of the car were known to complain a lot to passengers and cause them grief. And the driver started doing that to his mom, and she was talking back and not having it. And they argued a lot. He called her a whore. And there's two different tribes and of women. One was good and well behaved and the other was known as promiscuous and not well behaved. And he assumed she was the latter, the driver, so he kept referring to her as that type of woman called her a slut, and then continued to drive but super fast and dangerously not stopping only slowing down at stoplights. She asked if they could get out of the car and walk away. And he just kept saying, no, no, no, there were no other cars on the road. They were on Oxford Street. And so she looked down at her son and said when he slows at the next light we're gonna jump out. But he was sleeping. So he didn't know what was happening. When they slowed at the next light, his mom opened the door and threw Noah out and then circled herself around baby Andrew and jumped out herself and they rolled across the pavement. Noah remembers the pain. He was in shock as he got thrown out and then just remembers the pain hitting. And then his mom said run, and he said it was like animal instinct. He just knew what to do. And they ran extremely fast. The men got out of the car to chase them and tried to catch them, but they were too fast for them. He remembers looking back and seeing them give up.That they didn't stand a chance. I mean, his mom had won some sort of race or marathon in the past, they were a good runner.And he didn't think twice about having to run or that his legs were too sore. He just knew that that's what he had to do. When they finally got to a gas station or petrol station. They called the police. He asked his mom what happened? Like why did we do that? She said they were going to kill them. She told them the plan. He said, I didn't know the plan. I was sleeping. And then he she said that it was God's plan. And he argued and said No mom, like I'm sorry but when the car didn't start this morning, that we should have listened to God telling us to stay home. We shouldn't have gone out and she argued No. We're here for a reason. And then he made a joke and said okay, well can we tell Jesus to visit us at home next week or something? And they both laughed and it's almost super religious would be Jesus's fan club or something like that. And his mom was also very scraped up. Sorry, they were both very scraped up like he had a skin on his arms and legs was all torn and his mom was the same but baby Andrew was completely unharmed. That's it
