So in this story, it begins with a narrator saying that initially, he felt invisible to women until he discovered the salon and started taking care of his appearance to look good. And he says that no, no man spends as much time in the salon as he does to look good four hours to look good. He takes, following that, of course, he gets into a small playful back and forth with his mother, who he describes as very naturally attractive, despite any of the situation she gets involved in such as example given is in the garden where the mom is in overalls and she's still attractive. And his mom makes playful jabs at him like, oh, you spent four hours in the salon just to look good. I just took a shower. That's it. And it's a very nice back and forth between the two. The narrator later mentions that, despite her attractiveness, she's only had two people in her life as far as men go, which is his father, and the father and the stepfather. And the narrator is not an only child, he has a sibling, and there's a bit of an age gap between the two of them as a result. So yeah. And as the story goes on, the narrator said he was eventually going from his time as a child and the arcade, he's now a comedian, a successful one. And he gets a call from well, actually, before that, before that, with regards to the marriages from earlier, there's there was no big ceremony between just exchanging of rings, signing the papers. That's it. Hallelujah. So later on, the narrator gets a call from the from Andrew saying, in a very calm voice, that the first question is asked how the narrator is doing, and then follows it up with oh, by the way, your mother's mom has been shot, which confuses the narrator is one if such an events happened, why start off with how are you doing? And if his mom has in fact been shot, why isn't the caller distraught? And as a result of that, he asks, you know, mom's in the hospital, and he gets in his car and drives on. And obviously, he's very upset about it as it's his mother. And then he calls on the road asking, you know, how is she and what happened. And the caller says that the father came around and shot the mom in the leg to which there is some slight relief only for it to be dashed away when the caller reveals that the mother has also been shot in the head. And it's at that point, the narrator, is cries tears of how he describes as pain, not of sadness or anything but of just pure unfiltered pain and muses to himself that he had the the authorities knew about, for his father's belligerence for some time and he remarks he would have killed him himself if he was actually capable of killing someone. Narrative arrives at the hospital and sees Andrew there the caller and it is at that point that Andrew finally breaks down in tears of hopelessness rather than tears of pain and they will go in to see the mom who is in bed with a gauze over over her eye and nose, stitched up and otherwise in bad shape. But despite the hanging around and everything the doctors informed them that the mother is stable despite her condition, and there's nothing that they the visitors can do. It's best if they go home and rest and allow her to rest as well. And so they do that and the narrator comes back to the hospital first thing in the morning the next day to check on his mom and eventually she wakes up by opening her on God's eye. And her and her son share a very tearful, pleasant moment but she's not sad or angry that she was shot despite her son's protests. She's, she's happy to still be alive and she smiles. He has a very big smile, which Yeah, give some hope to the narrator. But yeah, I believe that's all I can recall.
