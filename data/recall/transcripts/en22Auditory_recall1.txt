The story talks about this guy. Actually, the guy's telling the story about when three Chinese students got in his school and one was called bolo. I think one was Bruce Lee. And the other was John and bolo he said that it was kind of like a pirate because he he made like pirated CDs. And Bruce Lee was called Bruce Lee because he was almost literally Bruce Lee. And then John was just John bola was the one that kind of introduced world of piracy to the main character that I don't know the name the guy that is telling the story. And they in his story, he says that bolo started like selling CDs, and pirated stuff to the whole school, and he made like, a lot of money. And he says that the three Chinese were scared of black people. I don't know why. And he also says that Oh, yeah. And then Andrew comes in, which is like a white guy. And he also pirate itself. And he gives the, the storyteller CD. Right, CD writes something like that. And that is when the storyteller starts selling like pirated stuff as well to the school. And he realizes that what people want the most of music is black American music. So hip hop, r&b. And also, yeah, that's it. And he also one of his friends recommends him to make like, mixtapes home. So he starts making mixtapes and mixing different songs and genres, and he started selling a lot of these CDs. So now he has like an empire of pirated CDs. And so he sells CDs, he makes a lot of money with the mixtapes and people ask him to make like, lighten the transition of the songs to make you like the transition smooth. So it feels like a DJ set. And people really liked that and start buying more of his CDs. So he says that, like he was basically a part of the music industry of like selling music, but he didn't know anything about music. He says that he he's like a born capitalist because he was selling stuff. He says that if it wasn't because of Andrew, giving him the CD, right? He wouldn't have like this empire of pirated CDs. And he says that have like, Andrew's family was wide, he was white, and what they took for granted like education and stuff like that he was not taking for granted. And in his family and he also tells like this or not analogy about like like, if you give a man a fish, he will like it the fish for one day, but if you teach a man how to fish, he will, like have food forever. But he says that what's missing is you give the man like a fish hook, you know, like, opportunity kind of.
