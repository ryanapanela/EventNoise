The son's name is Trevor. Same family from the first story. This is like an excerpt from comedian Trevor Noah. But I'm gonna ask but anyway. I start talking a little bit about his childhood. He talks about as a mom, first of all right, his mom was a beautiful woman at first, it does kind of sound a little weird, kind of fixates a little bit on how attractive his mom is and all that but eventually becomes a little bit normal. He's talking about his mom's beautiful on the outside and the inside. And even when she's gardening and covered in mud, you could tell, and that she must have broken a lot of hearts when she was younger. But she's only really had like two men in her life. One was his father. And then one was his stepfather. Basically, up until maybe like age four or five, I guess it seems like she was with the Father. If she left him or he left her with the situation. But that was, but eventually, I guess her car broke down. So it's kind of like after she split with the Father. And she brings it into this, like auto shop. And then she starts going to the auto shop frequently. And at first the son's like yeah, we just get to need to get the car fixed. We'll call the son Trevor.

But then eventually he's like, you know, we're going in and like, the car does need to be fixed. And he starts to catch on that there may be something else going on

there. And it's because she's got a thing going on with the guy at the car shop. I can't remember his name. I want to say Andy or something we'll just call him Andy. But so stepfather, Andy. He becomes stepfather. You know, he, I don't know if they officially really got married they didn't do any ring exchange or anything, but they did make it official. Trevor's around nine at this point and then like a few years later, so he must have been like, I'm guessing he like was maybe like at a point where he'd already moved out of the house. Just the way it kind of sounded cause he was staying somewhere. And then his stepfather had called him asking him if he was busy. And then he like, drove over to the hospital. Trevor like, was living somewhere else. And the story kind of jumped forward into like a when he was like, a bit older. But anyway, one night, his stepfather calls him and he's like how are you? Are you busy, and then he calmly says that his mother has been shot. So this strikes, Trevor, as really odd. Like, if you like, if mom's been shot, the first thing you would say is mom's been shot. But he kind of preface that with some unnecessary questions. And he just really shocked he's really scared. But so he jumps into a car. I think there's like a roommate or something that lives with him. So they both get into a car, and they're like driving. And I think he's still got uncle Andy on the phone. And he feels calm at first, right? He's like, Oh, I'm glad he's been calm. can't be that bad. Then uncle Andy he's like, yeah, she's been so your father, I guess showed up at the house. And he shot the mom in the leg. And so you know, he's kind of relieved at first because, you know, like, not so bad, but then also shot her in the head. And that's when he's kind of freaking out a little bit like, like, you know, what, if he loses her like imaging what kind of suffering and pain she's going to so he gets to the hospital sees Uncle Andy and Uncle Andy has been holding it together until then but Uncle Andy like breaks down, and they're both kind of like crying for different reasons. Uncle Andy, he's crying because he's afraid to lose her and he's crying because, like, of the pain she might be in. They don't know what's gonna happen with her age. She's in the hospital, but they don't know. The doctors tell them to go home eventually, because there's like nothing else they can do here. But he comes back the next day and he sits with his mom. And his mom's got like, stitches on her face bandages on the back of her head. She's, she's a sight for sore eyes. And eventually, while sitting there with her, he's just kind of like you thinking and he's really upset like the police haven't like the police could have done something about his dad like a long time ago and maybe this wouldn't have happened but he's like sitting there and maybe like an hour in her right eye opens and I think she wants water. So it gives her water and they sit there but it seems like she is going to make it through
