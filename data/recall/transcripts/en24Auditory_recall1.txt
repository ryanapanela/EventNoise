Here's a mother and son. The son starts off talking about how he spends hours in the salon getting his hair fixed. And that it caught the attention of girls. And how he was loving the attention he was getting. And his mom would make fun of him for spending all that time in the salon just for her to look the best. And he thought she was the most beautiful woman. But she only had two men in her life. A father and the stepfather. And they would go to church, often, a mother would be all dressed up. But she's he thought she still looked good in her gardening outfit. They want to a mechanic called Mighty mechanics, I think. And that's where they met Abel and knew he was this guy that they thought or she thought was like really strong. And then they started going there all the time. And then they got married. But it was a very simple thing, where they just signed the papers with no fuss. And then April in the mom had Andrew, who was born nine years later. But that didn't affect the speaker's life, because he still went out and hung out with his friends played outside as a normal nine year old. And then he grew up and he worked as a comedian. He was traveling. And then the younger brother calls saying that their mom got shot. And he's crying and he stopped at a traffic light. He remembers exactly which traffic light. And then He raised us to the hospital. And he sees his brother. But the brother has a stoic expression, but once the brother sees him, he starts crying. They have two different cries. And then he finds out that his mother was shot by it in the foot and not the foot, the leg and the head. And then the brother said that Abel just got out of the car and started shooting. And then the doctor told them that they should go home because there's nothing that can be done. The mother has been sedated. And the next day the speaker comes back. He's hanging out or not hanging out. He's waiting for his mom, but She's all bandaged up. And then the mother's uncovered eye opens up and she asks for water. And then he starts crying again. And then they have a conversation where the mother is telling him that he shouldn't worry and he's like, oh good, she could have died. And then the mother says that he should be happy because he's not the most beautiful person in their family. And yeah,
