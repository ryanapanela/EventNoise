This story was about about the narrator and how he, I guess, essentially, his views on oppression and like privilege and such. It starts off with talking about how three Asian kids come to his school. I think their names were like John Bolo and Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee was this guy. It was like, handsome, good looking or something, and his name was actually Bruce Lee. So he was just cool, I guess to narrator. And Bolo, his parents were his parents were pirate things to make money. And John was just a different Asian guy named John, I think. But the story is mainly about how Bolo would like, like his parents pirate music. Or, I think he talked about the gaming consoles and how he put a chip in it and like, sell it to like different kids in the school to, like, make profit. And I think there was an event where Adam, this white kid, would also, I don't, I don't remember what he what he sold, but I think he did. I think he would do something with the computer, as he was, like a geek of some sort. And they would like, sell things together, but then they would end up complaining to the main character or the narrator that, like, the black kids were like, kind of stealing from them, or like, they weren't really making back the money. So Trevor, Adam and Bolo kind of team up to, I guess, make profit together. And like, that's when, like the narrator talks about about how, like the black kids don't have enough things to even pay them back, so that's why they weren't and, you know, he would just help them out, I think. And yeah, they started working together. And then I think the narrator also made money together. But bulls parents, I think, moved away with him. And the rumor was something about how they got in trouble for, like, you know, the pirating things. And then I think, like, Adam also ended up moving or just leaving or something, and he gave the narrator, like, one of the CD I'm not sure if it's a CD player, but something that he used to, I think, make money, and then the narrator is, like, really grateful for that, since he was, like, now capable of having his like own business and like using that for his like own profits. He talked about how he was like a naturally good, or like, he talked about he was like a natural capitalist and how he sold, or like, he was good at selling these, like, pirated, like songs and CDs, and he would, it was, like, 1x play or something. So he copied it in like, the same time as the song would play. So, like, for like, 35 hours. I think he said he would come back from school and just, like, essentially, just copy these songs and then sell it to people. He specifically told about how, oh, essentially, this was, like, really helpful for him, and he made a lot of money, he talked about, and he, like, started falling out, I think, as he said, he started, like, he gave an example of this by, like, talking about how he bought, like, a cordless phone and, like, a time without smartphones and stuff. So, like, you know, he could go to McDonald's and, like, call his friends and while, yeah, call his friends and get McDonald's, like, still on the line. And how, you know, he was, like, That guy at that time. Yeah, he I um, yeah, and he ends up, I guess, at the end, talking about how, like, the like, what Adam did for he's, like, really appreciative of what Adam did for him. Since, even though it's like, in a way, a small gesture, and it's probably Adam just giving him something that he didn't need anymore. It allowed the narrator to, like, you know, make his own money profit, and talked about how, you know, in like, a greater, I guess, like thematic point that, like, he felt as if, you know, the underprivileged need,needed the help of the privileged, since they didn't have like enough, like, I guess, raw materials, or like the means to, you know, I guess, be successful. He specifically talked about how, even if he did have talent to, like, sell things to people without Adam's gift of like the CD player. He wouldn't be able to he wouldn't be able to do, I guess, what he he wouldn't be able to do, or like, make profit as he wanted, and like his, I guess talent wouldn't not been developed before this point, though, there was also another part about how, like, two people, I forgot their names, but how they also, like, helped him with like, oh, you know you should add, like, make a mixtape, rather than just like the entire album, since people only want to listen to, like, the good songs of the album, and how one of the other guys talked about how you should fade the songs together, so it's more, I guess, cohesive and there isn't like, like, a cut out between songs. And, you know, he thought it was a good idea. And, like, I guess these people helped him to, like, make more profit in terms of that. But, yeah, I guess the main story is about how, or the main point, I guess, is about how, yeah, all these, like little, small things helped him become successful. In a way, it was because of, like, Adam's like initial gesture.
