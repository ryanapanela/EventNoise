The narrator mentions how he is a young kid, has a younger brother who's only about nine months old, and talks about his mother as well. He mentions throughout the story, how religious his mother and his family is, when it comes to Christianity. And he talks about how he or his mother was trying to get somewhere it was for work. And when she tried to start up the car, the car wouldn't work. The narrator then explains how in parts of South Africa, especially when like when there's holidays, and when other people aren't working. The black population still works as maids and cleaners. He started explaining about the underground industry of many buses and private networks of transportation, when there isn't public transportation, or if you don't have access to a vehicle. These mini buses have popped up to serve a particular purpose. And it was essentially seen as organized crime because it is not regulated in the country. Different groups or companies would establish the routes that they would take and there would be turf wars or violence, when a driver would go on a route that wasn't intended for them. So now the narrator has mentioned how his younger brother, the mother and himself are going, because the car gonna start they go to like a central area, like a marked or essential area. And they're there to wait for a minibus because of how unregulated it is. It is not very consistent. If it comes it comes. If it doesn't, then it doesn't. But they were looking to pay money to use the minibus. Since nothing was coming by the mother decided to hitchhike. And the first van or car that she sees coming down, she asked if they could pick them up and take them for a lift. The man does that they started driving. And then the narrator explains how one of the mini buses comes out, stops the vehicle and starts getting angry with the man saying how he's not supposed to take people on their route and cut it on their business and take clients. The man was getting beaten up. And the mother was just explaining how Oh, leave him alone. He was just trying to help me. We were trying to get on a mini bus anyways, we'll just get out and come with you anyways. And the narrative explains how in circumstances like this, those drivers usually would get killed. So now, the three the family, the three of them, they ended up leaving this car and they get onto the mini bus. The mini buses is empty it's just the driver and I believe the two men that were pretty much like the enforcers that were enforces, the routes that they drive. As they're driving the bus driver with these unregulated modes of transportation it's they're notoriously known for harassing and speaking out speaking illy of the passengers, especially with women. So the narrative explains how the driver is just talking out loud talking to the mother saying how you know, it's not a good thing that a woman with two young children is going out and getting rides from men that aren't her husband. And then it was just mentioned how because the sons are mixed, that the driver found out that she is with a white man. The mother doesn't take it to kindly or silently with the harassment that she's receiving. She speaks out as well, and is defending herself and telling the driver to mind his business, then the narrator explains how the driver recognize that the woman the mother is from the is from a different ethnicity. And the background with this is that these two ethnicities are kind of like sworn enemies. So a lot more tension rose and the driver is now being is now talking her off and speaking illy of her because of her of her ethnicity. The mother continues to speak out and defends herself. And then the driver ends up saying how he's going to teach her a lesson. Or the narrative explains how that could end up in, you know, murder, kidnapping, sexual assault and the narrator explains how as a child, he was just asleep, and didn't see any panic from his mother just saw that the mother was just trying to calmly console and persuade the driver to just let them off here that they'll just walk from here on out and apologize for offending him. The driver kept on saying no. And he just kept on speeding up. And we're just only slow down during intersections to make sure there's no traffic. But we're just continuously speed on that the narrative that explains how the mother whispers to her to the narrator saying how when the driver slows down, we're going to open the door and you're going to hop out of a moving car. The narrator initially started this story by saying how in Hollywood movies, the actor would jump out of a moving car would roll and then just get up as if nothing happened. And he just explains how this is not true. There's just so much pain, and that it's not true that you could just easily get up after getting out of a moving car. The mother tells the narrator when we slow down, we're gonna push you out. The narrator explains how he was pretty much half asleep and didn't really understand what his mother was saying. And then all of a sudden, as the driver slows down at one of the intersections, she slides open the door and pretty much pushes out the narrator and then following him, jumps out herself with the nine month old baby brother. And the narrator explains how they're just rolling and rolling and tumbling. And they eventually stop. The narrator explains how he was just very, very shocked that this happened because he wasn't aware that this was going to happen. But that after they came to a stop, he realized just how much he was hurting and he was in pain. He notices that his mother is already standing up with the baby brother, and told the narrator to start running because the two men in the in the minivan got out to try to chase the woman down. The narrator explains how they were able to run way faster and how the the other men were just bewildered that this all happened that a woman and her two children just jumped out of a moving vehicle to escape them. The narrative that explains how when it comes to his upbringing and his social surroundings and circumstances how such kind of violence is normalized or it's very common, and the people that are very used to it. I explains the example of you know, if you see police out in riot gear it's it's time for you to run and take cover. Because violence is kind of impending. So pretty much the mother and the two children, they start running, they run to a local petrol station, that is open 24 hours, that's where they call the police. And as they were calling the police, the Narrator explains how upset he was at his mother and that was wondering why he was thrown out of the van. And the mother says how Oh, you know, we would have been killed by those men if you know I didn't do that. Just how she saved his life
