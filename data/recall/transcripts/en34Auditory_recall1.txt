Okay, so the story started and they were talking about how at school there were three Chinese kids. There was, firstly, John and Bono, something's something like that. And then then there was Andrew and then the other guy and Andrew became friends. And then one of their families started who was known for pirating CDs and movies. So then Andrew and the other guy, and I guess the speaker started doing it together, and then they said something about, they didn't, or like they got into fights, or didn't like the black people. And then then the third speaker started pirating all the stuff for him for Andrew, and then was saying that they that when he was growing up, he only listened to like Christian and church music. But then now he he has been exposed to a whole bunch of different types of music, including Nirvana, and then said something about like, he doesn't judge the types of music that people listen to. Oh, there's definitely a lot more but that's all I can remember. Right now. Oh, let me see. Anything else?
