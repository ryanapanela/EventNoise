I started getting my hair braided in time for the matric dance. And I started getting a lot more attention from girls. I'm not sure if it was because I looked better, or because they recognized that I was willing to subject myself to the same kind of pain that they would go through when getting their hair cornrowed. So I continued to go to the salon four hours a week, every week to get my hair straightened and cornrowed. My mom would tease me we would often have little jabs at each other as we did. From Monday to Saturday, my mom worked in an office or puttered around our garden, like a homeless person. But on Sundays, she would put on a nice dress and some heels. And would tease me saying I hope you enjoyed being the best looking one in the family for most of the week, but now the queen is back baby, you have to go get your hair done at a salon for four hours. And all I had to do was take a shower. And it's true, she was very beautiful, both inside and out. Even when she was in the garden with her overalls and dirty clothes, you can see how attractive she was. I'm sure she broke a lot of hearts back in her day. But since I was born, there are only two men in my mother's life. My father and my stepfather. So around the corner from my father's house, in name of neighborhood, there was a garage. And we would take our Volkswagen there when it needed repairs. And then we would start going there more and more for any reason. There was a tall, lanky, strong mechanic there named Abel. He was handsome, but not good looking. Which was what my mom liked. He was strong enough to lift a car. I didn't really know what was going on. I just knew that we were spending more and more time there. Even for no reason. My mom used to call him AB and he used to call her nickname for her name shortform. When my brother Andrew was born, I was nine years older. All I can remember is that my mom was gone for a few days and then she came back with him. So being nine years older, there wasn't really much sibling rivalry. I would just be playing outside or at the arcade. I didn't have to change any diapers. And eventually I moved out and I was touring in countries abroad such as England, working on becoming a comedian hosting radio shows. When one day my phone rang early in the morning, it was Andrew. He asked me hi how I'm doing and if I'm busy. I responded by saying well, yeah, I'm trying to sleep. What's going on? Then Andrew then said, mom's been shot. The two things that went through my head was if mom's, he sounded completely calm as he said it the two things that went through my head were if mom has been shot, why would you call and ask first if I'm busy, or how am I why not just say that mom's been shot. He's completely calm. I didn't even have to ask who did it? Because I knew I knew that it was Abel. I asked him Which hospital she was at. He told me name of hospital. I hung up right and down the corridor and knocked on friend roommates name door, let him know what's going on and we jumped into the car. Thankfully the hospital was a short 10, 15 minute drive. In the car, I called Andrew again and asked him what happened. He sounded calm. As he said they're coming back from church. And dad was in the car in front of the house, he came out, took out a gun and just started shooting. I asked him where he said in the leg, I had a moment of relief thinking that she would be okay. And then he added and then also in the head that moment I started crying, bawling uncontrollably. crying so hard that if my current crying self could look back at past crying selves, it would tell them that this shit is not worth crying about crying in the only way that I can describe as not having any other way to express this emotion that's been stuck in front of me. I kept driving and I don't know how I drove through the lights. How much crying I did. We finally arrived at the hospital. Andrew was there at an outdoor seating area in the front. Once again, he looked completely calm even though his clothes were smeared in blood. We went in to see my mom and she was the back of her head was banded. She had gauze over her nose and left eye. And it was the first time I had seen her look so frail and so tired. I sat beside her. And once her non bandaged I opened. I couldn't hold it together. And I just started crying. If we go back to the car scene, when Andrew first told me that she was shot in the head and my body just collapsed. When we met Andrew at the hospital, he also started crying like he finally broke back to the hospital beside mom when she opened her eyes. I broke again and just started bawling and couldn't stop. She says, baby, please, please don't cry. I was cursing god in my head. I was cursing the police for all the times they didn't do anything about Abel being violent to my mom. I was cursing God because all my mother ever did was pray. If there was a fanclub for Jesus, she would have been the president. My mom says please, Baby, please don't cry. I told her I was so scared you were going to die. I didn't want you to die. And mom said I wasn't going to die. You must always look at the bright side. Now, you can say that you're the best looking one in the family. She laughed and squeezed my hand. I started laughing through my tears and sobs.
