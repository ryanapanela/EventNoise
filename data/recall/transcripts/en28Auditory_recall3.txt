Okay, so basically the story starts off by him saying that he one day like he got cornrows or something. And like he started to get like a lot of attention from girls at school. And then he like went back. He wasn't sure if it was because of that or because like, he said, like, oh, because now like he's, he knows, like he's experienced with the same type of like, hours that it takes to get ready or whatever as they do. So like, maybe that's when he was getting more attention. But anyways, he kept going back to the salon, and he would be there for like a long time, like hours and hours, they would straighten his hair and braid it and like all that. And he would come back home and like his mom would be like, his mom was always like wearing just like regular clothes, like around the house. But then every Sunday when it came time to go to church, she would like dress really nice. And she would like yeah, like, be like, look like a totally new person would just like dress. Yeah, really well. And so they would always go back and forth on these jokes saying, like, who's the best looking person in the family. And she would like make fun of him or be like, you have to spend hours and hours to like, look like that. But I can do it really quickly. Like, I just have to take a shower to look like this and they would like, have this running joke and go back and forth. And she basically she said something about? Oh, he was saying that like no, like, obviously no kid like, wants to be like, oh, yeah, their mom is so attractive. But he was like she was like objectively like an attractive lady. And then she would go to the mechanic and like to get her car fixed or whatever. And there was this guy there named Abel. And then they started going more and more often. Even when her car didn't need to be fixed, and so they just started going often. And then she really liked him. And he wasn't like, really good looking. But he was like a handsome guy. And then she the mom was explaining how like, you know, girls like guys that are not that, you know, like not like that great looking for like, kind of like medium ugly. And then so then he was like he was just around all the time, that guy and they ended up getting married. And then they ended up having a son, which was like his brother Andrew. And then he was basically saying that it didn't really change much for him because he was like nine. So like the baby was born. But he just kept doing the same things like went to play with his friends and stuff. And then a lot of time passed years. And he was like making his career as being a comedian and traveling around and doing radio shows and all of that. And so then he gets a call from his brother one day, being like, are you busy? Mom's been shot. And his first thought was, Why is he asking me like if I'm busy, like you would just lead with mom's been shot. And then he also didn't realize that in the conversation. He didn't ask anything about like, you know, where was the mom shot? And so anyways, he was like, Okay, I'm coming straight to the hospital. And so he jumps out of bed and he goes to the hospital, and he's driving there. And I guess he calls back and he asked like, where I think he calls back anyways, he's on the phone with his brother again. He's like, where has mom been shot. And at first he said or who shot her. And where has she been shot. And so I think at the beginning, he knew already, he didn't have to ask who shot her because he already knew that Abel was the one that shot her. And then he's talking to his brother again. And he's like, Oh, he shot her in the leg. We just got home from church. And then he just started shooting. And he shot her in the leg. And then he shot her in the head. And when he said that, then the narrator just started crying. And he couldn't. It was like a type of pain that like he couldn't express it any other way. So it wasn't like any time that he's ever cried before. It's not like he was. Yeah, it wasn't like catharsis or anything like that. It was just like his body couldn't express the pain that he was feeling in any other way. But to just like cry like that. And so then he couldn't see the road and he was just crying. And he was like, just get there like, you know, just try to get there. And so he gets to the hospital and he like runs inside. And he sees his brother and he's covered in blood. And the brother was like basically holding it together until he saw the narrator and then at that point, that brother started breaking down. And so then the narrator ends up going into the room and seeing the mom and she had like bandages and gauze and like one of her in like stitches. And they basically said at that point like she's stable, there's nothing else you can do for now. So just go home. So they left and came back the next morning. And when they came back, he was sitting with her and she opened her eye because one of her eyes was bandage and she opened the other eye and she saw him and as soon as he saw her like open her eyes, he just started crying. And then he couldn't stop and then she asked for some water and she leaned forward to drink the water out of this straw. And she basically was trying to soothe him and was like, stop crying like it's okay. And he was like, yeah, he was still crying. And she was like, No, don't cry, like, look at the bright side. Oh, and he said at one point, like, he was really angry, because he was like, his mom, like, really loved God and like, REALLY love JESUS and stuff. And so he was like, he was like, she was like, he said something like being a part of Jesus's fan club. Like, she was like, she really? Yeah, like, was religious. And so then he was he was saying, like, how could this happen to her like, she does all this. She's like, devoted to God and Jesus, like, how did this happen? And then, anyway, so then back to when she was talking to him. And she was like, Look, you have to look at the bright side. And he was like, there is no bright side, like, How could there be a bright side and this like you were just shot? And then she like she said, she was like, well, at least now you're the best looking one in the family. And then they both started laughing. And it was like, yeah, he didn't say this, but it was like a really sweet moment between like, the two of them and like, that was like their incident. It connects back to the beginning anyways, so yeah. So she, she said that to him, and then they both started laughing. And yeah, that was the end of the story.
