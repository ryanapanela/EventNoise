So the narrator begins by talking about how there are very few minorities at his school growing up. And there are three Chinese kids out of the 1000 kids in the school. Bolo, Bruce Lee, and John. And so Bolo, he, his parents sort of pirated movies. And, you know, being a son of parents who pirate he also sort of fall in his footsteps. And, John, nothing was quite special about John that the narrator mentioned. And Bruce Lee was sort of like a real representation of Bruce Lee, you know, use big and strong, tall, muscular. But at least the kids this story focuses more so on Bolo and you know, their business pirating sort of movies and CDs. So I think Bolo had pirated music with this kid, this white kid who was about two years older than him, named Andrew. And Andrew was he had a CD writer, which made the process so much easier, and is about $200 in like, I guess US dollars, but or 2000 in the currency the author mentioned. I mean, it's very rare for people to have CD writers. So these two kids went into business together. But one thing that they had trouble with was, you know, getting paid back sometimes. And their afr- afraid of sort of black kids at school and you know, doing business with them, they sort of were deterred by it, because sometimes they would tell Trev-, sorry Bolo and Andrew that, you know, they'd pay them later. And they never did. And so Trevor's, like, that's sort of just how people are, you know, if we can get something for free or for cheap, you know, we'll do that. And so Trevor was like, I'll help you with that problem. I'll be your middleman. And so Trevor would get the CDs and help sell it. And in exchange, you'd get a cut of the pay for their profits. And so Trevor had a great network, and he was able to help them sell the CDs and and so these three boys had worked pretty well together. And so with the money that Trevor got, he invested into sort of upgrading his computer system. And, you know, giving it more memory and storage, upgrading the hard drive. And like the equipment he had, and his friend Andrew or his business partner, was a computer geek. So I helped him out with this and told him how, like what to do or what this and that meant. And so these three guys were pretty good friends, and they've been running this business well. And I think they would sell like CDs, like with whole albums, for like, $3 a piece. And so that added up quickly. But one day, Bolo sort of. Well, not quite disappeared, but like he no longer goes to their school. And so the rumor around is that their parents, his parents got arrested. pirating. And so then it's just Andrew and Trevor selling CDs, and then eventually Andrew, sort of quit this game, or this business of selling pirated music. And so he gifts Trevor, his CD writer for because Trevor has been such a loyal business partner and a great friend. And Trevor can't believe this because you know, once again, it's rare to have a CD writer and they're so expensive.  And even for what Trevor perceives himself to be isn't like or like his committee, as you know, usually underprivileged. He's very grateful for this. And so he continues the business of selling pirated music because he has a knack for it. And yeah, so he keeps doing this and the CD writer, it sort of is at 1x. So it writes at the speed that the song is. So if the song is five minutes, it'll take five minutes to write. And so he would, you know, whatever kids wanted, he, he would copy for them. Like, he didn't judge, the only music he knew, though, was like, Christian music, and from church. So despite, you know, copying all this music, he didn't he wasn't so familiar. And he didn't listen to it, either, because of the thing he mentioned, which is, you know, don't get high on your own supply. So he didn't want to, you know, indulge in other people's music. Because and nor did you want to judge it. So what are people asked, he got for them. And then his friends from different schools, gave him ideas as well, to you know, sell mix CDs, which would have the most popular songs from certain albums, because usually, people, you know, although they have the whole album, they might just want one or two songs. So he did that. And it also sold well. And then his friend also gave him the idea to make songs sort of fade into each other, like DJs might be able to at a set. And so Trevor was able to download some software that allowed him to do this and mix the sounds, or the songs together, sort of smoothly, and. And he kept upgrading his setup. So he also had car speakers that he found from a junkyard. And he had them up. And, yeah, he was so successful, at some point that he was able to even get like a cordless phone. It's just before you know, telephones, or like wireless cell phones were out. So like those big, bulky phones, and he, he bragged that, you know, he could set up to the receiver and walk two blocks from it, to like McDonald's and still be on his phone. Which is not a privilege that many people get. And so he reflects back on his experiences sort of selling and he he thinks fondly of Andrew at this point, and how it's sort of like a small representation of you know. Like, the privileges that you know, white people have, and what impact that can have when, you know, minorities are actually helped. And so he compares us to sort of the analogy or the saying, you know, give a man a fish he'll, you'll feed him for a day and teach a man to fish, you'll feed him for life. But one important thing is the fishing rod. You know, although people might have skills and knowledge, they don't might not have the resources to actually be successful. And that's something that Andrew provided, and that's sort of something that you know, is sort of forgotten in society that you might be able to build someone up in that way, but you also need to help provide them resource and it's not a handout because, you know, they still work hard for what they earn.
