So the story is about this person called Trevor and he is in the ninth grade. And he starts the story off by saying that three Chinese students joined his school in ninth grade. It was somebody called Bruce Lee and other dude called John and a dude called Bolo, I think. And he spends a minute making fun of all their names, because he says that Bolo got his nickname in school. And he said that Bolo's parents were professional pirates, because they would, like sell pirated things in flea markets. And then Bruce Lee's name was actually Bruce Lee, there wasn't a nickname. And that really helped helped them in school. And he said, Thank You, Jesus for bringing us closely. And then he said, John was just John. And then he said that he actually had a tech shop business in school where he would just sell tech to students. And there was Bolo, and he, there was an 11th grader called Andrew, who owned a CD writer, and Bolo, and Andrew had a business together where they would sell, like CDs with music to students, and like their business was getting really big. And Bolo and Andrew, were talking one day, and Trevor heard them and on the, in the corridor, and they were talking about how they, they were talking bad about black students, and they were talking about how black students always come up to them and take the CDs and say that we'll pay you later. And we never, and they never pay them back. And Trevor, join the conversation. And he said that. Yeah, like, that's because us black kids don't have money. But like, I can join your business, and I can help you out, like, make me the middleman in your business. So I am through my tech shop, I already have my clientele, and I can sell your CDs through that. And I can ensure that like I can take the money from them. And then I can give you give it back to you. But just give me a card of the sales in the middle. And then they're like, Yeah, sure. And then the three of them start their business. And then Trevor goes on and on about how Andrew has a CD writer and how that's really cool, because nobody really has a CD writer, they're super expensive. And Andrews a total music nerd. And then so that they they work together for a year and the business going really well. But then Bolo leaves school after a year because the rumor was that his parents got arrested for the pirating. And then it's only him and Andrew and then Andrew. After some time, he's approaching graduation, he's approaching like he's going to graduate soon. So he stopped the business. Like he like personally exports out of the business. And he also gives the CD writer to Trevor and he says that this is for you. So that Trevor starts doing the business on his own. And he he said that the CD writer only writes CDs for how long like the songs play, like it writes them at the same pace as the song is played. So he would go home after school and sit in his room for five or six hours every day and just write CDs with like music online, like music from the internet. And he said that he would just go back to school and sell a bunch of that. And he was making a profit. And he after a year of doing that he eventually got his own two middlemen his friend two of his friends. I don't remember the names. And then they would also take a cut from the sales and then one of the one of the middlemen one of his friends they he suggested to Trevor that why don't you instead of downloading entire albums oh sorry before that, before he got the middleman in Trevor also spoke about how he would never judge people's music taste. If you like Nirvana, he'll give you a CD of Nirvana if you like the DMX he will give you a CD of DMX. He was not it was not about him to judge. He was just he was just looking to make money through all of this. And then when one of his middlemen after some time, they suggested that instead of burning entire albums into a CD, why don't you only burn like the top hits of multiple albums into one CD because people only want to listen to the music to the songs they like not the whole album. And then he said that this is really great idea. So he started doing that and selling those mixtapes. And then after a point the same middleman he said that why don't you try to make sure that when the first song ends, and the second starts there's a bit of like a like, it sort of fades into each other almost like a DJ is doing it. Then it'll be like, the CD has like somebody's DJing. And the beat will continue. And so he started doing that. And he started selling those DJ CDs. And they really, they were also really a huge hit. And the two middlemen one of them went to Northview, I think he was the one who was saying all this. And then, like the DJ series were a super huge hit. And they started earning more money. And he said that the business is really thriving, and he was earning a lot of money, he got another CD writer, he got more equipment, more CDs, he would just download stuff on the internet, and then send it off to people using those CDs. And he sort of got super like, into that business. And he said that he personally didn't have any knowledge of music. He wasn't a music geek, like Andrew was, which is really weird, because he was in, like the music, pirating business, so he should have a better understanding of music and just everything like that. And then he, after all, this after the story, he gets into a little bit of a monologue about how they sort of taught him a lot about, like, the concept of just oppression, and how Andrew was white. And while his family was preparing for college, and when he was going to college, and to getting that support. Trevor said that me and my ancestors, and my family was being sat in a hut and being told 23 6326, stuff like that. So he said that people like Andrew, like he said that black people have been denied the opportunities that people like, Andrew, like white people have taken for granted all their lives. And that people always like to say, take a man to like, the fish proverb that give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day, but whatever. And then, Trevor said, but people never say, people have people want to talk about Teach a man to fish, but people never want to supply these people a fishing rod. So how are they going to fish, even if you teach them and, Andrew gave him the CD writer, which was instrumental in him developing this business and getting so good at it. But if, but he realized that you need, like one of these privileged people to give you give you a hand give you like the support to lift yourself up, and people want to call giving him the CD, either a handout, but it's not a handout, because he still has to work for where he is, he still has to do his business. So just getting the CD writer would have been useless without his own business, just as him with all his talent would have been wasted if he never got the CD writer. See, he's really thankful to Andrew, but he also wants to talk about the nature of oppression and how it's not really a handout. It's just giving the oppressed people the tools and the resources to sort of lift themselves up and not have to like, I don't know, look for scraps or something like that. And I think that was mostly it. But I'm just gonna think for a second. Yeah, I think he was also talking a bit about how people want to just like shout at the poor people and be like, take responsibility for yourself. But nobody really helps people do that. And it's not that poor people aren't taking responsibility for themselves. It's the fact that they've been denied the resources and the opportunities to do so.
