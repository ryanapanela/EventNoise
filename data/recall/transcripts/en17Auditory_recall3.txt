Trevor Noah opens up about another aspect of his childhood. So when he was younger and in school, three kids transferred to his school and they were Asian of Asian descent, or Chinese, I'm not sure if he's a Chinese or Asian but either way, there were no other Asian or Chinese people in his school at the time and three kids were Bolo, Bruce Lee and John. Bolo was called Bolo, based on a character in a Jean Van Claude Damme movie. The Bruce Lee character was actually not like it wasn't like a nickname or anything he was literally named Bruce Lee and he was a good looking handsome guy. And the other guy was named John which Trevor kind of found odd given that these other two had like different names but Bruce Lee and John don't really factor in the story stories more about where things kind of started with Bolo. Bolo started this bootleg business in school because his parents were doing a bootlegging business where they would sell anything, movies, and music and stuff, kind of like illegally and for cheap and they would make a profit. And he did the same thing at the school, mostly music, CDs, PlayStation stuff, so he would get Playstations from people install a chip and after a few days, bring it back and then sell them games that would be compatible with the chip. And so business was like, taken off and it was good. And eventually, he connected with this guy named Andrew, who was like two years older than Trevor, white guy, and he started working with him because Andrew was a tech geek computer geek also had this CD writer. And back in the day, CD writers were huge. This is when not a lot of people had them. So you could use a CD writer to write songs or like copy albums and stuff like that. And but each one was like 2000 Rand, which was quite a lot, Rand is like the South African currency, which by a team kind of like necessary for the thing. So him, they combined forces, Bolo and Andrew, on their business started taking off, but Trevor happened to overhear one day them talking about how it made them kind of nervous to sell to black people. Because the black people weren't, some of them weren't paying up or paying the full amount. So Trevor approached them and was like black people are poor, they don't really have anything. So they're always looking to like save money on things and whatever, but I can solve this problem for you. Let me be the middleman. Let me be the guy that, sells your product to the people deals with the people and in return, I want to cut of the profits. And they love this idea. So they started to do this and it was going really well. For a little while until Bolo suddenly disappeared from school. The rumor was that his parents got arrested. And so with Bolo gone. He was now working directly under Andrew. But then eventually, Andrew how to matriculate out of the system. It's high school or whatever. So before he leaves he bequeaths Trevor, with his CD writer, which is huge. Because Trevor had thought about getting a CD writer? It was 2000 Rand. And if he had gotten it he could do, you could start writing, like copying albums and to CDs and doing stuff like that. But he couldn't without one and he couldn't afford to get one and with Andrew bequeathing this to him, he now became the sole or the main person running this bootleg operation. And so throughout school, he was making money. He was he would go home spend five to six hours copying these albums. He had these old like speakers that he got from like a junkyard old car speakers that he had in his room, when the music would be playing through them into play through them fully. Each time he was copying them and he try not to listen to them because he felt like a dealer didn't need to get high off his own supply, his words. Anyway, I guess business was going really well and he hires two people to join him. One of them's name started with an M. And that guy had a couple ideas. So he was like why don't you start putting the hit songs on like one CD? Because people don't want to listen to a full CD. They want to listen to specific songs and during this time, like the popular music was like, black American hip hop. He said Montell Harding or something was like a popular artist. And so he thought it was a good idea and he started doing that
