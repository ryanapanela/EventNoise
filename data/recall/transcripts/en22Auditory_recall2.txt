Okay, so the story begins when the storyteller's says mentioned tau in Hollywood movies. When people jump or thrown out of like the moving vehicle, they are always fine. They're never hurt. And he says that that's not real, because he had like an experience like that when he was nine years old. So he starts telling this story of when he was nine years old. He starts saying that it was like a normal day. In his life. He just woke up, and his mom was getting his baby brother, and you're ready for them to go to school, I think. And they start going outside of their house, and they start turning on the car, but the car was not working. It wasn't, it was not starting. So they decided they're going to get the minivan. But in South Africa, in that time, they said, the storyteller said that black people did not have public transport. So they had to create their own public transport, which was this kind of a minivan minibus. Can't Knock company but like, many of us, like, type of public transport, but it was illegal. So it's like, each route, and each bus had their own owners. And if you took like the wrong route, and you're taking like someone to like another route that wasn't yours, you like the minivan like owner would be killed. So it was more like have a an illegal, minivan company and busy business, that's the word business. And so they decide that they're they want to get like the minibus minivan, because they need to go, they need to get the they need to get to school. So they are at the stop waiting for the vehicle to come. But it never comes. And at this point, they're going to be late for school. So the mom says, Let's hitchhike less hitchhiking as for like, someone should take us where we need to go. And they finally get like, someone finally helps them. And when they are like inside the car, the minute one of the minivan owners, stops the car. And he's holding like this big weapon, which I think it was called Zulu. I don't know if something like that. This big weapon. And he stops the car and makes the driver of like the car, get out and they start like beating him up to guys start beating him up. And the mom and like, and the the storyteller and his like brother, like they are not understanding anything. So the mom gets out of the car and ask them to stop. And the minivan guys, they're, they're mad because they say that the guy that was giving them a ride was stealing their customers from their business. So they say that owner, the mother says that they wanted to get the minivan in the first place, but he never arrived. So they had to like find a second option. And they ended up going to the minivan. And the one of the drivers finds out that like his mother. I don't remember the name, but there's like Zulu, and another one. It's like a is it. I think he's like an ethnic group, I'm not sure in South Africa. But he finds out that she's part of the other group. And he has like this prejudiced view of this other group, especially of the women. So he starts calling her name start saying that she's a slut just because she was taking like a like getting a ride from the other guys like car. And also because she had she had like a mixed baby so he was mad about that, which that makes baby is the storyteller. And he says that she's gonna have to pay for what she she did. So he starts like speeding up his car, his minivan And the mother at this point is like, wondering what she's going to do, but she never freaked out, which made like the storyteller not freak out. And the idea, the mother's idea was to literally jump from the movie, like when like the, the driver stops like for for a minute, they would like jump off the moving vehicle. So they could escape. So the mother tells that to the, the Son, but he's not really listening at this point, he's kind of sleeping, and almost sleepy, so he doesn't understand the plan. So when the driver stops the car, the mum literally pushes the, the one, one of the boys, the storyteller out of the car, so he can run away and she wraps the baby, her baby Andrew. And she also jams from the car. And now they realized that they are out of the car, but they still need to run because the drivers stop the car and try to go after them running after them, but the mother and the and the storyteller, they are way faster than the drivers. So they they are not caught by them. And then they realize they're all covered in blood because the adrenaline kind of inhibit their like pain. So after they realize that they're like in pain, they're, they're bleeding. And they end up going to like a police station. Fire report. And then Oh, yeah. And then the mother says that it was it was thank God that like they didn't die and something bad happened. And the storyteller is like, No, it's not thank God. We should have listened to like, God or Jesus. In the beginning, when the car wasn't starting, we shouldn't have left in the mother says that. It was all God's plan that they got there. And that happened to them. And then finally, the storyteller says that if the mother really loves Jesus, tell him to like come meet us at our house, at their house, because he doesn't want them to have this experience again, and the mother starts laughing and that is the story.
