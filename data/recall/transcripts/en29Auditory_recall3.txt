The story starts with the narrator talking about three Chinese kids that moved into the school of 1000s. Bolo, Bruce Lee and John talked about Bruce Lee being a good looking individual who they were all excited for it because his name actually was Bruce Lee. John, they didn't go into any detail about it. And Bolo, they talked about his his getting his name from the Van Damme movie. And Bolo's parents were bootleggers, or they sold pirated movies and CDs and such games to local shops. So he inherited his the idea of that from his folks and started bootlegging things for school. He would put chips into, he would take people's PS five or PS Playstations and put chips into them so that they could run bootleg copies. Then he would sell the bootleg copies to people at school. Him He made friends with another person, I believe the name was Andrew, who was also a bootlegger. And they both started a little business together, just selling things to the people at school. But both of them were scared of black people. So they were so when people would come and ask for bootlegged CDs or whatnot. They would give it to them so they pay him back later and then they'd be too scared to ask for the money back. So the narrator decided that he could be the middleman for them. So he offered his services to exchange the products and get them get and get the money and or for a cut of the business which both of them agreed to. This was very successful for a while, until and when they when they eventually stopped doing it. As a thank you, Andrew gave the narrator a CD writer, which he was very excited about because he said he was a natural capitalist who now he had the the sales, marketing and could execute production. So he slowly leveraged it from selling selling albums. He was some some of the South African albums were a little popular but it was mostly black, Western, r&b and rap and such. That he sold that was the big sellers. He eventually built the business he started slowly building the business up upgrading his computer, upgrading his disk readers upgrading everything until he got two middle man. I can't remember their names. He specifically talked about one who kept coming to him with ideas. The first ideas were more about what if you made a bunch of different songs or different songs from different albums into one and make mixtapes? So he started making mixtapes and they sold pretty well. And a few weeks later he said what if you had this progression of one song to another with no disturbance in the middle as if it was a DJ playing at so he started he downloaded a program called BPM beats per minute in which he the the icon was two vinyls side by side and he could use that as a way of making party mixes which sold very well again. After building up this business for a while at it, he started becoming a baller so much of a baller that he was able to afford a non line phone, a hand or a line free phone. But she was very excited about because at the time cell phones weren't a thing. So the fact that he could put the receiver outside his bedroom window and walk down the street to his McDonald's, order his number one, and walked back the whole time while talking to his friends with his antenna fully stretched out his very large phone to his ear, he was very excited and proud of. And he finished the story by talking about class issues and, and race issues with how the fact that because Andrew was a white person, he had the ability to go to university and to, to have a higher education and to have all these different resources available to them, gave him the ability to do everything that he was doing, where the narrator himself who was a black man, based off of what they said, very early on in the story was, was given a lot less, a lot less privilege. So he wasn't allowed, or he wasn't. He had to, to work harder to do it. And also he wasn't given the proper tools to succeed. So he talked about how a lot of people say that the poor need to step up with this but and just work harder. But working hard isn't the issue if you don't have the tools in hand to succeed in the first place. And just because you're given tools, it's not a handout, it's a a ability. It's it's what you do with it that really makes it makes or breaks and he was just thankful that that's he was given the CD writer so that he could utilize it to make a fortune enough for him to live his life.
