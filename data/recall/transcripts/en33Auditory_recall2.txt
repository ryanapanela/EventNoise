The speaker's name is Trevor he had his hair braided for a school band it was in cornrows I think straight bakcs and he noticed that the girls really liked it. He was really popular with the girls anytime he had his hair braided or cornrows.Yeah, so he often got his hair cornrows so he would get more girls. His mother didn't like them. She thought that it made him look prettier than her. And his mother wasn't the type to get dolled up every day. She would kind of laze around the house, or not laze around the house, but look more bummy from Monday to Saturday, when she was going to work, and just around the house. But on Sunday, she would wear a really nice dress, and really get herself dolled up. And then she would make fun of him and say, she's now the most attractive person in the house. She's now the prettiest person in the house.He only knew two men in his life, his father and his stepfather. His mother used to own or his mother owned Volkswagen and they often broke down and they would go to a mechanic and the mechanics name was started with an A was Alan No. Abel Abel, mechanics name was Abel. And he would often repair it the car he had long limbs. And he was handsome, but kind of an ugly, handsome, like, medium ugly. Yeah, he was handsome but not attractive, or not beautiful. Something along those lines. And they would often go to the mechanics place. And eventually they started going even when the Volkswagen was fine, and there was nothing wrong with it. They would still go. And eventually he started. He was six at this point, Trevor was six. And eventually his mom and Abel got married. And it wasn't like a wedding per se. There was no ceremony or exchange of rings. Instead, they just went to the courthouse and signed a couple documents and came home and they were married. Three years later, when he was nine, they had another son Andrew, his little brother or half brother. He he never really noticed his mom was pregnant. He just noticed that one day she left. And a couple of days later, she came back with Andrew and he cried a lot and shat a lot. And yeah. He noticed that he noticed her coming back like while he was watching television, I think. Yeah. So as he grew older, he became a comedian and went off to England, I believe, to do some shows. He lived with a roommate. And one day while he was in his room, his brother Andrew called him and I asked him how he was he said fine, and asked him if he was busy. And he said no. And then proceeded to let him know that his mom had just been shot. And he was confused because those two problems. Firstly, why did he ask how he was doing and how he was feeling if his mom was just shot? Or like, what did he ask how he was doing? Or if he was busy if his mom was just shot. His mom was just shot like that's something that's the meat and potatoes. That's the main event he should have started off with that. And yeah, that was a second problem. The second problem was his mom was just shot. And then Andrew said this in like a very calm voice, calm and monotone. And he dropped the phone and he ran downstairs, told his roommate, him and his roommate jumped in the car and they were driving to the hospital. Luckily, the hospital was 15 minutes away. And as they were driving, he called his brother Andrew again, and was asking about more about the details of what happened. And he'll never forget, he was in front of this light. And that's when his brother told him the story of how they were coming back from church and they were in the car and his mother stepped out and his stepfather came out and shot his mom, once in the leg. And then once in the head, or there was like a pause before he said she was shot in the head as well. Larger pause. And he kind of froze. He was in shock. Well, not Andrew. But Trevor Trevor was in shock. He was frozen. And he started bawling in solving and he was very, very emotional. He cried like he'd never cried before. He talked about how if he if he was able to go back in time, and slap his previous self based off like, crying about like incident, insignificant things, he would go back and because this was like the most like this was the worst thing that's ever happened to him, it was very painful. Yeah, so at that light he'll never forget, that's where he learned that his mother was shot in the head. They drove to continue driving to the hospital, Trevor and his roommate. And when they got to the hospital, he jumped out of the car. And he ran straight to her room. He saw his brother outside, and his brother's head was down. And as soon as he got in front of his brother, his brother, look at his before he his brother saw him. He kind of looked solemn and like, monotone in a way. And as soon as his brother saw him, he jumped up and his brother started crying. Andrew was bawling as well. And they hugged. I think they hugged and, yeah, Andrew was crying and crying. The physician, the doctor came and told them that she was stable, and that they could go home. So they went home. And then the next morning, they came back, or he came back, Trevor came back, and he sat by his mother's bedside and was holding your hand and he noticed that there was a bandage wrapped around her head and around one of her eyes. And there was stitches, I believe at the back of her head. And he was, he was crying again. And his mother opened the eye that wasn't bandaged up. And she asked for water. She drank the water. And then she asked him why he was crying. And he had said, like he had just been shot, oh wait, major part a major part of the story that I forgot. So rewind back to when he was in the car on the way to the hospital in front of the light. He knew that his stepfather was the one who had shot his mother, like he knew that previously, it seemed like they were in an abusive relationship. And his brother confirmed it. When he was on the phone with him while he was in the car. His brother said that his stepfather was the one who shot him. Yeah. Okay. Back to present. So yeah, his mother was holding his hand. And she asked him why he was crying. And he told her like he she had just been shot. Of course, he was sad. And he was very angry at his stepfather. He wished that he could have gone back in time and killed him before he hurt his mother. And but he knew that he wouldn't have been able to do that because he was a lot smaller than him. His mother then said, Oh, look, you need to look at the positive side. You need to look at the brighter side of things. And he was like, what would that be? And she said, Oh, that you're now the most attractive in the house. And they laughed and they laughed and laughed and laughed and yeah that was it.
