The speaker begins talking about how Hollywood movies, the way they depict car chases, is not the same as the reality where in the movies, you jump out of a fast moving vehicle, you just have to dust yourself off, and then you'll be good to go barely any scratches, bruises, any indication of pain. And then he talks about his experience. And how him his mom and his brother were getting ready to go out and their car wouldn't start. So they had to take public transportation. But there was a law or something with white people how that prevented them from doing so. So they had to take private own buses and trans transportation of such. And. These South African drivers had very bad tempers and attitudes. And when they were in a car, or a no, not a car, wash bus, another driver drove right in front of them stopped them and fought with their driver. And said that they were stealing their customers and that a lot of fights normally happen with these private owned companies. And once they got onto the other mini bus, the drivers were arguing with this mother. And they talk about how there's two stereotypes for women, one that's well behaved and beautiful, and the other one is on faithful and promiscuous. And then the mother kept saying no to the drivers and telling them to leave her alone. And then they, the drivers started speeding up and only slowing down for certain intersections. And the speaker was really tired during all of this. So he didn't fully understand what was happening. And then the mother told him that they're going to have to jump out once the drivers slowed down at the next intersection, and then she open the sliding door and push them out. And then she jumped out holding the brother. And then she yelled at him to run. And they started running. And then the drivers caught out and they wanted to chase after them. But they were too far ahead. And they kept running until they got to a 24/7 gas station and then the police had to bring them home and then the mom and the speaker get into discussion about how the mom says it was God's plan. But then the speaker was just like no, it's not God's plan because if it was God's plan, they should have like you know, God sent them signs that they should have stayed home with our car not working. And then he realizes how much pain he's in and how he's all scratched up and like his skin is cut. His brother doesn't have any in Drees and then They start laughing once the was that one anyways, the speaker gets mad at the mom because he didn't understand what was happening and he was really tired and he didn't understand why he had gotten thrown out the mothers like they were gonna kill us and then yeah
