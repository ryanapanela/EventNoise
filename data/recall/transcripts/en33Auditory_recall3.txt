The story begins with. I'm assuming the speaker's name is Trevor again, talking about how people in race cars were often, like when they were thrown out of cars,it seemed like they were barely hurt. And then it jumps into the story of how he was thrown outside of a moving vehicle. And so he starts off with talking about how he and his mom were at home with his nine month old brother Andrew. And they'd gotten into the car, and the car didn't work. So they weren't able to move. So after like, after a couple of tries, it still wasn't working. So they left the car. And they went to a mini mini bus stop. So this was during the apartheid, the South African apartheid. And black people weren't allowed to take public transit. And so he was, so a group of black people had come together, and they had made their own type of public transit, essentially. And they called it mini buses. And each mini bus was controlled by different groups of people. And they often fought for routes to take, and the minibuses were not consistent at all. And like sometimes they would show sometimes they weren't, sometimes they wouldn't. And sometimes it would take a long time for them to show. So they had been waiting him. Trevor, his mom and his little brother, at nine months old, had been waiting for a minibus for a while, and none came. And so he also talks briefly about the apartheid and segregation. Oh, he talks about how, even though the black people were expected to come over to, like the white side to clean people's houses, they, they, they were kind of left to fend for themselves and kind of get to the houses themselves. And so that's why the mini buses were created. So moving on. They were waiting at the side of the road for a minibus, and they'd been waiting for a while none had come. And so his mother said, let's start hitchhiking. So they walked a bit, and they were walking, and a car pulled up beside them. And the man there was a man in the car, and he offered a ride to them. So they got in the man's car. And he'd only driven he only drove like, a couple meters, I'm assuming. And a minibus came out of nowhere and kind of parked, like, right in front of him, like cut him off in the middle of the road, and parked there. And two men came out, one of them was holding a traditional Zulu weapon. And it was a weapon to take off people's heads. And he went to the driver's side of the car, he pulled out the driver. And he started threatening him talking about how he was trying to poach people from his route and how that wasn't allowed. And, yeah, Trevor talks about how Zulu people or like, the bus drivers tend to get very violent. And so his mother interjects and says, Oh, we were waiting for you to the bus driver. She says, Yeah, we were waiting for you. But we were waiting for a while. And this nice man just like kindly allowed us in his car, like, we'll come with you. So she gets out of the car with Andrew and Trevor, and they get in the minibus, and the driver leaves the man alone and the man goes off in his car. And so they enter the minibus and the minibus driver is kind of like he's very angry. And he's kind of antagonizing them as well. And minibus drivers are also known to be violent. So yeah, so he gets in the car. He's driving, and he starts, I guess, like talking shit and His mother wasn't allowing that. It seemed like the driver was very misogynistic. And yeah, so Trevor and my mother was not allowing that. And she was talking back. And as soon as she started talking back, she, she spoke in Xhosa, the language. And he, the driver figured out that she wasn't Zulu that she was Xhosa. So he and those stereotype with Zulu men and Xhosa women, so Zulu women were known as docile and gentle. And Xhosa women were known as like whores, and very like loudmouth and like, they talk back a lot. And so the driver was like, Oh, your Xhosa. So that's why you're getting into like, strange men's vehicle, vehicles and stuff like that. And yeah, and his mother was not letting that die down. Like she kept on arguing. And the driver was getting increasingly angrier and angrier. And then he called his mom a slut. And then he said that, he said, something along the lines of I'll show you what we do to sluts or I'll show you what we do to Xhosa woman. I'm not too sure. And then he started speeding like they, he started going super, super fast. And at this point, Trevor was really tired. And he was like, he wasn't really attending to what was going on in the car. And he kind of started nodding off. But his mother was still his mother didn't seem to be like, in distress. And she was like talking to the man and trying to like, negotiate with him, saying, like, Oh, I'm sorry, if I offended you out, we'll get out the car, like you can just stop, we'll get out of the car. But the man did not want to let them go. He was saying no, no, no, I'll show you. I'll show you what we do the sluts, something like that. And, yeah, he kept on speeding up. And he would slow down at every intersection to see the the speed, the driving speed limit for the intersection, and then he would speed up. And that kept on going for a while. And it didn't seem like he was going to stop. So his mother. At this point, Trevor was pretty much asleep. And his mother whispers to him. And she says, Oh, Trevor, I'm going to open up the door, and you're going to have to jump and then I'll jump behind you. And so she says that but and then she opens up the door. So she says at the next intersection. When he slows down, I'm going to open up the door, and you'll jump and then I'll jump. So at the next intersection, the man slows down, she opens up the door. But Trevor doesn't jump because Trevor is asleep. And he didn't hear that his mother had said that to him. So his mother grabs him and throws him under the car. And she also wraps herself around Baby Andrew and throws herself out of the car. And they roll and roll and roll and roll. And finally, or like his mother landed first his mother landed beside him. And then they started rolling, and rolling and rolling. And then finally, he stood up. And he looked to his side. And he noticed that his mother had also stood up. And yeah, so then they started running as soon as, as soon as they stood up, his mom said, Run. And so they started sprinting. And he talks about how the drivers were also sprinting bus behind them. So the driver in his lackey, or whoever was in the car as well with him, start sprinting, chasing after them. And they were, and he talks about how him and his mom were super fast. And they were known as they were like the winners for this specific race, like this specific school race, I'm assuming. And yeah, so they ran really fast, and they ended up at and then after running for a while, the drivers kind of gave up chasing after them. And so they stopped and like, he turned around and he saw them, he saw that they had stopped and they were kind of like leaving. So him and his mom ran all the way to a petrol station. And they stayed there. And then he he got angry at his mother and he was like, Why did you throw me out of the car like what had happened? And his mother was like, I told you to jump but you never jumped I open the door but you didn't jump. And he was like, I was sleeping. I didn't hear anything. And his mother said, oh, so would you have rather me leave you in the car with the men that were gonna kill you? And he was like, well, at least they would have woken me up before they killed me. And they were kind of bickering for a bit and then they were standing outside the gas station or the petrol station and talking and then yeah. But eventually, like, they Oh, they call the police. They call the police. And they call the police I believe before they started arguing. And Trevor also noticed that he was kind of filled with like bruises like his body was filled with bruises and cuts, as well as as well as his mother's body. But Andrew was unscathed and he assumed that his mother did do like a really good job of like, surrounding Andrew and making sure that he didn't get hurt at all. And yeah.
