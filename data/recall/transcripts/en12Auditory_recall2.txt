The narrator throughout the story mentions how this all takes place in South Africa. The narrator starts the story off by saying that he's in grade nine, so they're in school or high school. And that these three Chinese students came to school. There were the only three Chinese students amongst 1000 at the school, and he explains their names. Bolo, Bruce Lee, and John. He just talks about, you know, their names and how they got a chuckle out of it. And how he became friends with Bolo. He mentions how the parents of the Chinese students, they are into piracy. So pretty much downloading illegal movies or video games or music, and selling them for cheaper. So the bootleg or bootlegging industry these students met with the Chinese students met with another person by the name of Andrew mentions how Andrew is a white person and talks about how they started working together to sell their bootleg content also mentions how they were having issues of collecting money from customers who happened to be black. So that's where the narrator starts explaining how he can work as a middle person or a middleman to collect the money and help with sales. The narrator goes on to explain how he was able to make some money working as the middleman with Andrew and bolo, but then mentions how the three Chinese students just didn't come back to school because the rumor, the rumors were that their parents got arrested. That's why they couldn't or they weren't in school anymore. The narrative just starts working with Andrew, helping him sell. And then Andrew, he's from a privileged white family mentioned how he's going to be moving on to other things like further education or is moving on to a different career path or industry. He the narrator mentions how it's very expensive to have a CD writer and that Andrew actually bequeath it him, the CD writer after he told him that he's going to be done. The narrator starts taking on the business and the clients for bootleg material talks about video games, movies, and then just mentions music. He mentioned how he doesn't really know much about music, he's only aware of church music, which is only allowed in his household. So he would take requests from his clients and download whatever music he gave some examples like DMX and Nirvana. He ended up hiring two middlemen to help him out with the selling. It was his friends and then one of them just suggested some ideas about instead of bootlegging albums. You could just bootleg on one CD, the top hits of different albums and putting put them onto one CD. The narrator did that and he was able to make some money off of that. The friend also suggested you know remixing them and transitioning them so that it felt like it was like a DJ live playing the music did that and that was a big hit when it comes to parties. The narrator also explains just some of the logistics with the CD copier how this was just during a time where it was very expensive and how it costs the same as a computer mentioned how it takes the same amount of time as what you're recording or downloading for it to completely download. Now he would spend several hours to download whatever he needs to download at a full setup in his room with speakers that he salvaged from a mechanic junkyard where he was salvaged car stereos and speakers into his room. He mentioned how he made a lot of money, and how he was balling out, mentioned an example where he bought a cordless phone and this how this was before cell phones, and how if he kept the base just outside his window, he would be able to walk two blocks down to the McDonald's, and still be able to be on the phone and have reception. Then he starts explaining how, when it comes to oppression and privilege, and how the equality and equity that goes with it, how some people may see that him being bequeathed a copy, or CD copier can be seen as a hand down, but mentioned how it's necessary for the well off to be connected with people that may not be as privileged or oppressed. And how it took that connection for him to be able to raise himself up and be able to make ends meet and talked about the analogy of  give a man a fish and he'll be able to eat for the day, but if you give the man the skills to fish, then he'd be able to eat for life. And then also mentioned how you know, it's also important to give the fishing rod and that's just the analogy of being provided the means, you could have all the talent and knowledge but if you don't have the means of implementing it, and it's almost just as useless.
