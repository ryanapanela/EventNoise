the narrator's name is Trevor. He has a nine. In the timeline of the story, his brother was nine month old. And is named Andrew. He's still a baby. And the narrator said he used to watch these Hollywood films where you know people would, characters would just chase each other. And then and then one of them would just jump out of a car and then stand up, pop up, and then they dust themselves off. But the narrat-, Trevor said, he always thought this was crazy, or like ridiculous, just because no one could ever jump out of a car and, you know, not be injured, and be okay. But then he started telling the story about when he was young, and then his mother, him and his brother are about to go out. But then when they're all ready, the car just will not start, there's something wrong. And then. So they decided to take the, you know, the mini bus just because at the time, public transport system for the black people for black people weren't really there. So they had to use some organized crime services, basically illegal, illegally run public, non public book of transport for black people. And I remember him, the narrator saying that white people still needed black people to mop their floor and clean their house or something like that. And then, so the narrative went on and said a lot about how the the illegally run transport for black people were dangerous. So I think there were a lot of corruption and murder. And you wouldn't steal the bus routes just because you would get killed by you know, those people who run the who ran the train not train but like, transport system for black people. And then, so his mother, him and his brother waited for a really long time. But then there was no mini bus. And then so a man offered to you know, give them a ride. But then just as the man was, like, driving two man from a minibus, presumably black people. They, I mean, I don't actually know if they're black people, but I would assume just because they said it was like a transport system for black people. And so I guess it would have been run by black people. And then. So these two men, they came out of the minibus and with their weapons, something about, you know, some of them could I don't know. Something about a skull, I'm not sure. And then just they hit the, that the two men hit the really nice men who offered to give the narrator his mother and Andrew a ride. And then they just hit him really hard. And Trevor's mom said, say, stop. He, she spoke up. She said, Stop. He's just trying to help us. He was offering us a ride, we'll go with you. That's what we always wanted. We just couldn't find, you know, a mini bus. And then so the three of them got on the minibus and then the driver was really, really angry. He's a really, I guess he's a really bad man. He's a really easily irritated man. And he's he was very historical and he just kept yelling. You know, just he's just kept yelling, saying how Trevor's mother should not have gone on another man's car, who, you know, when the man is not her husband, there was this distinction between like a Zulu woman and between Zulu woman and Xhosa. Woman. Zulu woman or like, just, you know, it's more like a, it's like, I don't know if it's elegant or like good or like, just considered to be good in general and then Xhosa woman is just promiscuous and unfaithful. And so her Trevor's mom did not just sit there and let you know, a man verbally abused her. She stood up for herself. And she said my own business, but the driver just kept you know yelling at her. He wouldn't just shut the fuck up and then and then some and then and then something. And then the driver said, you know, that's what that's what's wrong with you Xhosa woman. That's why oh, that's why you're a Xhosa woman. And that's why you were behaving like that. That's what you would get on a man's car around like a stranger, who's a man, a male stranger's car. And then the driver said, I'm going to teach you guys a lesson tonight. And Trevor's mother kind of knew that they were gonna kill him. And then Travis mother's like, you know what? She was still trying to like reason with him. She was like, You know what, I'm sorry. Just let us off. We can like walk that. She said it multiple times but then the driver was like, constantly No, no, no. And then, so all during all this time, Trevor was pretty unconscious. She was he was kind of sleepy. And so his, his mother told him Trevor the next, Oh So yeah, the lights. The driver was driving really, really fast. And like one of these, you know, one, you know, a few times, he would just slow down to check for the traffic light. And then so Trevor's mother said to him, Trevor. The next time he slows down. I'm going to pull the cars like they were sitting next to the door, the slide and I'm going to pull a slide and then you're going to jump. Okay, but then Trevor said what he she couldn't, like he couldn't hear her. But then, like, right after the driver slowed down a bit. Her mother just pulled the slide on the door. And then Trevor wasn't jumping so. So his mother just threw him outside, and then she, I think she like rolled herself around Andrew, and then just jumped, got off and then they were both and then, like, Trevor hurt was hurt real bad. Like, he was just tumbling and tumbling. They were just all tumbling and tumbling. It hurt a lot. And then Oh, yeah. And then Trevor didn't know what happened. Because he was just oh my god, why am I so he was like, So Trevor didn't really know what happened. He he was just threw out of thrown out of the car. Because remember, he could not he couldn't hear what his mother said earlier. So he was just really surprised. And then and then he rolled and he rolled and somehow he stopped and then his mother was already on her feet, even though she jumped later than him. And then his mother yelled, run and then so he ran. And then they did
