So the story is about Trevor, who is talking about his mom and a horrific situation that she was in. The story starts with him saying that he started getting his hair braided into cornrows at the salon once a week, because he thought that that made him look better, and it would give him a better chance with the ladies. And his mom used to make fun of him for for spending four hours at the hair salon doing that, and she would be working throughout the week. But then on Sundays, when they would go to church, she would do her own hair and put on a nice dress and look great, and they would laugh about the fact that she would be the best looking in the family. Once she got her hair done on Sundays. Then the story moves on to Trevor saying that his mum has only been with two people in her past. His dad and his stepfather and his mom and Abel got married, and then had his brother Andrew, who called him one day to have a conversation with him asking him how he's doing and if he's busy, and Trevor tells him that he is in bed. It's 10am and he's sleeping and what does Andrew want and Andrew tells him that his mom has been shot. So Trevor says that he finds that very weird. He finds two things are weird the fact that Andrew called him to say, how are you instead of their mom has been shot and asks him if he's busy again when he should have told him that their mom has been shot. So Andrew tells him the story that Abel should shoots their mom once in the leg and then another time in the head. So Trevor asks where they are. And Andrew responds that they're at Livingston hospital. So he wakes up his friend and they go to the hospital where he sees Andrew. He goes in to see their mom who is bandaged up and has one eye bandaged and he sits next to her he thinks that she's sleeping but she ends up opening her non bandaged eye and smiles at him and tells him that she's okay and that he should be happy because he's now the best looking guy in the house. And so they have a little bit of a laugh about that. Because she's poking fun at the fact that now she's no longer the most beautiful in the house.
