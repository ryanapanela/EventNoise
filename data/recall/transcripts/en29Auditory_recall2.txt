This story started with Trevor the narrator talking about how he liked to do his hair up. I think there was so much background noise It was really hard to hear the first bit he was talking about his the time he spends on making himself look good. And how his mother was always poking fun at it. And how his mother was always in rags and dirty clothes and except on church day where she excused herself up and made herself look beautiful. And she, they were always joking about how she was the queen. That came. The queen is back every time that she got herself up. And they talked about a automotive shop that I think they went to can't quite remember the name of it. Playa Grande something where they met this not are not handsome but not ugly person may I think his name was Andrew, where who she eventually married. They had a son together when he was about nine years old. He remembers her leaving for a few days with them. She came back and there was a kid that was eating, shitting and living there. But he didn't have to take that much care of him since he was nine he just had to play video games and do kid other kids stuff. Eventually he grew up and became a comedian and was living
with someone from the sounds of it and one day he got a call from from Andrew his brother, not the husband who said "hi how are you?" After that, he said his mother has been shot. Which as soon as he heard he felt very overwhelmed with emotion and he was in his house and he left to drive to the hospital which was about 15 minutes away. Think he knocked on the door of someone to go with him. He then was talking about the shock that he was feeling and how it was setting in and and he was asking how his his mother was shot. And over the phone I believe he then heard that this mother was shot when she was coming back from church his father was in the driveway and shot him her in the neck and then again in the head until which he started going cold and can't remember when the light turned or when the light turned green and he was just driving through with blurry eyes from tears. When he got to the hospital. Andrew was waiting outside for him and they walked up to be there for a while until the doctor has said that there isn't she was stable and there's nothing else you can do so you should go home. So they came back I think the next day or she had a bunch of bandages on the back of her head and one of her eyes was bandaged. He was chat talking about how close they were and how she was Such a big, big part of his life. And then she eventually opened her unbandaged eye. And they started talking it was very hard to hear since the narrator went to a whisper at that point. The the sound was almost twice as loud as it but we were talking about how it was her how to look at the brighter side of things and stuff and he didn't see a brighter side. He was also thinking about how God could do this to someone who was so devout to him. How, how if she if there was a Jesus fan club, she would be in the top 100 For sure. And that was also what I can remember.
