Okay, a son. And his mother had a great relationship, the two of them. And when he was younger, he remembered. He felt good about himself all of the sudden, thought he was a good looking guy. And his mom came home Monday went into the shower came out, and teased him and said, you have to work so hard and get your hair cut to look good. But I just shower and come out looking beautiful. And this was their relationship. And then, one day, the mom met a man named Abel, and they got married. He and she got pregnant, the mother got pregnant and had a son. And this was the older boys, brother, and he was nine years older. They grew up and he the son, older son, went away to college, and then became a comedic. And one day, he saw his mom's name pop up on his phone. And he answered the phone and it was his younger brother. And he asked him how he was and if he was busy, he said, No. And then he said, Mom has been shot. And he thought it was very odd that he asked him if he was busy. And how he was doing before he just said that his mother had been shot. And there was something else he found weird about the conversation. I can't remember what it was. And then he jumped out of bed and said he was on his way. The little brother told him what hospital they were at. He went to his roommates room and told him his mother had been shot and they jumped in the car. And then as they were driving, he broke down. He called his brother back. He assumed that his mum was okay because his brother wasn't crying on the phone. But then when he called him and asked him what happened, he said they were driving home from either the church or the grocery store. And they were late, coming home. When they got there. Abel was in his car and he came out and shot his mom in the leg. And then in the head. And when the older brother heard that she was shot had time stopped and he remembers exactly what traffic light he was at. And he felt he cried like he has never cried before. And he said this was merely from pain. That he felt knowing his mother had been shot in the head. He rushed into the hospital room, cried when he saw his mother. They said she was stable. There was nothing they could do at night and come back the next day, then he came back, came in and held her hand. And there was a bandage on her head, covering one eye and the non bandage eyes started to open. He started to cry and she said, Don't cry, don't cry. And he said, How can I not cry? How can I not be upset? My mother almost died. And she said, Look at the bright side. And he said bright side what bright side? You were shot. And she said You're finally the better looking one in the family. And then they laugh together and tease each other like they always did in the hospital. On a bright, sunny day
