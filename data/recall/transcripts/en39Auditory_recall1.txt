The story was about a guy who was black, I assume, had three Chinese people move into his school, John, Bruce Lee and I forgot the third one's name. Bruce Lee had a friend, Andrew, who sold the guy a CD player. Andrew had this business where he would where he would take people's computer and install pirated apps into them for a certain amount of money, and then return the computers so that people could play these pirated games. The guy himself worked at a tuck shop, and so when Andrew sold him the CD player, he I guess, like, learned how to, no, I'm getting that wrong. But there was an incident when, there was an incident when this guy heard Andrew and Bruce Lee converse about how the black people at the school didn't pay up front in the like exchange of Andrew's business, like when they would sell their computers, they wouldn't pay up front, and then they would say that they don't have the money, and then they would avoid paying. So the guy inserted himself as a middleman and ensured that the black people would pay up their dues. And through that, he learned the way of the business and how selling and buying works. Eventually he expanded in some ways. One of his friends came up to him with ideas for expanding his business, but before that, he also mentioned that the only music allowed in his household was Christian church music. And so he wasn't well informed about the music industry, but he was he did have a talent for the marketing business, like selling, buying. So he would sit for hours, five to six hours, and record CDs, but he would not listen to the music as much. So when you would be selling the CDs to people. He wouldn't judge the music taste people had, and so, as I mentioned, when his friend came up to him with several ideas to expand his business, it was actually that one of the ideas first was that, why don't you compile a series of all the best songs in every track onto one CD,because what people really want is to listen to the best songs of every track? Sorry, yeah, listen to the best songs of every track. And so the guy did exactly that. And then one of the other ideas that his friend came up with is, why don't you take all those best songs and compile them into one smooth transition, like add the transitions in just as a DJ would. And so he did exactly that. He bought, he downloaded this app, I assume, or the software called beats per minute, and he compiled like, he transitioned all the songs into a smooth like he transitioned between songs. So he basically did what a DJ would, but in a CD form, he finessed through the songs, as one would say, and then he saw. And his business skyrocketed through the roof. He also mentioned how he started to get in over his head, and he also bought a cordless telephone in which he could walk with which he could walk two blocks to the nearest McDonald's and walk back while still being on on a phone call. So it had large range. It had, well, according to that time, it had large range.  I mean, then he concluded the story by mentioning how people always say how, how the poor should do something with their lives and get somewhere. But most of us, like most of the poor people, don't have the resources to actually get to do something with their lives, like, as he mentioned, his own story about how he had the talent, but he didn't have the resources until he was provided with a CD player or a CD writer, not sure, by Andrew, Who was white, so the White had resources, and they had education and money to do all these things, and they took them for granted. And so while the white were preparing to go to university, the poor were just there, doing whatever it took to survive. So, that's what he was playing out. He was He also mentioned this famous saying that people always say that if you give a fish to a man, he will be fed for a day, but if you teach him how to fish you will be fed for a lifetime. And then he also mentioned that what people forget to say is that you can teach a person how to fish, but you also have to give them a fishing rod for them to actually succeed. Yeah. So he also mentioned that he was very thankful to Andrew for selling him that CD player and providing him with the resource to make use of his talent.
