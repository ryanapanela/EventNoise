Okay, so the story starts with him talking about Hollywood movies and how unrealistic like car chasing scenes are and like jumping out of car windows and such. Because he'd experienced it himself. And then he kind of goes into the day that that had happened, where he was with his mom, and his younger brother. There was something that led them to be in, oh, their car, their car, wasn't working, their car wasn't working. And I guess they decided to take the bus system. And he explains that under apartheid, in I guess, South Africa. The buses are like an unregulated type of thing that is basically regulated by the black people that live where he's from. And so he went on, they went on a bus route that I don't know if they mentioned that, I think is different. Maybe it's like different from like, the tribe that is responsible for whatever bus route they're on, or whatever, I don't know. And then oh, wait, no, I lied. First. They, they're in a car with a stranger, for some reason. And then, yeah, they're in a car with a stranger. And then they're driving. And then for some reason, they get out of that car, and they get into a minibus somewhere else. And then on that bus, that's when the mom and the driver get in a fight. Because she was in. Yeah, because they have like, very antiquated, like gender roles, or maybe it was the time. And they, yeah, they get in a fight. He basically calls her like a horror, the bus driver calls mom like a whore. Because she has like two small children. One of them is mixed. She belongs to a tribe, I guess that are like enemy tribes with with that drive with the driver of that bus. And so they're in a conflict. The perspective of the narrator is a kid, I think he's nine, or something. And he has his little brother with him. But he says he's sleepy, and doesn't understand why they're fighting. Sometime in between that. They end up getting thrown out of the bus, like or she thinks there's there's some sort of altercation. They feel threatened, the mom feels threatened. And she's like, we need to get off this bus. And so she throws the little kid out of the bus. And she herself they all get on the bus. And then what happens. And then yeah, so then the from the perspective of the narrator, the narrator is like, Well, why did you just throw me out of this bus? And then wait no. So yeah, they're out of the bus. And then they get chased by somebody, by people and the people chase them down the street are out there. They're running. Basically, they're running for their lives. He talks about how his mom and him are like really fast and they never catch up to him. And that the guys that are chasing them want to kill them and that's why they're being forced to run. They make it to safety. I guess. The mom is like thinking God that everything's okay. They get in a fight or like a argument about not like it's not gods that we have to think like, why why did this happen? Like we should have just listened to the side and not left the house period. And then the mom thinks that's funny and laughs and that's it I think I mentioned the little brother was a baby. Yeah, it's whatever.
