Okay, the story starts off with the narrator, talking about how he starts paying more attention to his hair and his appearance. And he starts going to the salon. He spends like many hours getting his hair done. And his mom is sort of poking fun at him because she's a very beautiful woman. And she just basically takes a shower, and she looks put together and beautiful. And she's like, kind of making fun of him for having to spend so much time on his appearance. And as time goes on, she was also the mother was only married twice to his dad. And then she started going to this auto mechanic, often to get her Volkswagen repaired because it kept breaking down. And so I guess, she started seeing the auto mechanic whose name was Aiden, I believe. And then eventually they got married. And there was no ceremony. And then shortly after, they had a son. So the narrator now has a younger brother. I think his brother's name was Andrew. And then he goes off. Narrator I don't remember his name. He goes off to work, you becomes like a radio like, talk post or something. And he does like talk shows. And then one day he gets a call from I believe it was Andrew, his brother who says that his mom or he asked him if he's busy. And what she finds a little bit weird that he asked that. And then he says that his mom has been shot. And he didn't even have to ask. He knew that. It was his dad and I think they were talking about the stepdad but I'm not sure. So he goes to see his mom in the hospital. He's really distraught about it. His mom was shot twice, once in the face. So she's in critical condition in the hospital. And she goes to visit her and she's still I don't think she's conscious. Eventually she wakes up and you know, he's crying and Andrews crying and I can't really hear what they're talking about in the hospital because it's pretty mumbled and soft spoken. But she was basically telling him to like look at the bright side of things and he's like, What are you talking about? You're just been shot. And then they're kind of just connecting and yeah, that's all I remember.
